I know, that I commented several days ago with the suggestion of a note, but I still have doubts about this PR. As I wrote, this change is not a BC break according to our BC Promise, however, it can break end applications if someone does not use routing generation, but uses the path.
IMO, the best solution would be to create new routes and change the problematic ones to be deprecated aliases, ref.: https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html#deprecating-route-aliases
Wdyt?

They only allow to deprecate `alias` (route name, not path) and not a real route, while we're changing route path without changing route name. There is no mechanic for proper route deprecation as far as I know.

If it's not covered by BC, then `upgrade` note is more than enough, imo. Both those buttons are covered with csrf, there shouldn't be random users of them.

@GSadee we can't fix every case when somebody follows the bad practices. If somebody uses the path instead of generating it, then it's a problem on its side, not our ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
