There is still a problem with sorting,
The sorting by Price (with getting the first variant) works with this implementation, but the problem is happening when we also try to filter by Taxon.

Behat from features/product/viewing_products/viewing_products_sorted_by_their_discounted_price.feature:21
covers this scenario.

Maybe someone from the community has any idea why this SQL error pops up?
