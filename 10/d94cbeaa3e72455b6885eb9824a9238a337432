@pamil Could you include this into the next release? Clearly a bug and simple fix. Thanks.

@Zales0123 do you want me to change the base to 1.8?

Ping @pamil again. Think this is an easy bug fix.

The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. **Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up.**

Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute `git fetch origin && git reset "patch-5"` to update your local branch.

Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck :+1:

Not sure what you mean, do you still want this branch to merge against 1.8?
There was no conflict in this PR so should be ready to merge anytime.

Anyway I have rebased the commit against the latest 1.8 branch.
