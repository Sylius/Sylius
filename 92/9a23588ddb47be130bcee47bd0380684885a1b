Hey Max,

can you rebase once again? Tests are probably failing due to bc break at Symfony end (see #11542)

I rebased the feature on a working master. So if it breaks now this should be my fault.

One thing I am not sure about is the message about the product being not active in this channel. Which would in turn also solve the issue #11559 .
