No idea why PHP 7.2 application build fails :/

> No output has been received in the last 10m0s, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.
Check the details on how to adjust your build configuration on: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#build-times-out-because-no-output-was-received

I feel like it's just a lag time that has lasted too long (more than 10 minutes).

I think relaunching the build can validate (or not) this idea ;)
