Well, basically the `random_bytes` function should be preseeded with a value, just like you can do with i.e. the [Carbon library](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-testing). But this means that you either need to create a lib to do that or find one that does.

Or you could do what @Zales0123 says ;)

Do you want to do any of this in this PR? If so I probably need some pointers as to where you want the `PathGenerator` class or if you have a lib in mind, which one.

We've just had a little discussion about this with @lchrusciel in the office ðŸ˜„ We both think that service extraction would be the best choice, but on the other hand, it would be a BC break and lead to many extra things to do (deprecations, fallback to old function etc.)... I don't know is the value of such a test worth so many actions ðŸ˜„ cc @Sylius/core-team

Well, personally I probably wouldn't, but on the other hand it lowers the quality of this exact class ;) I don't know if you any system in place where you put issues like this for future implementation? :)

The idea of extracting the path generation logic reminds me of a PR I made some time ago, #3703.
