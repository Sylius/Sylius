Hey Olivier,

can you rebase to newest 1.7? It may fix the build.

Hi @lchrusciel ,

Rebase is done, and "application" is green on Travis, but "doc" still red :disappointed:

Our 1.7 branch is red again, we will try to fix it in the nearest days

Can you rebase again to 1.7? We could fix it there, I assume.

The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. **Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up.**

Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute `git fetch origin && git reset "product-variant-comparable"` to update your local branch.

Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck :+1:
