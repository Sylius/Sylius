I'm not sure is it a BC break or not... What if somebody overwrites one of these files in their application? I suppose it would fail üòï cc @pamil

@Zales0123 Those are config files and cannot override them like templates. üòÑ
But it will break the imports.
Technically it's a BC break, but it's very unlikely someone will import those 2 files separately, usually the `@SyliusAdminApiBundle/Resources/config/app/config.yml` is imported.

@vvasiloi indeed, my imagination got out of control xD To prevent this not-so-likely-but-possible BC breaks, we could leave `@SyliusAdminApiBundle/Resources/config/grids/payments.yml` and `@SyliusAdminApiBundle/Resources/config/grids/shipments.yml` and import the correct files in them üíÉ We should also type some comment in them, something like `This file has been replaced by <new file name> and will be removed in Sylius 2.0`.

I don't know, maybe it's too protective for such a simple case, but if we can avoid potential BC breaks with a little amount of work, I would do that ‚öîÔ∏è still cc @pamil

If it were files referenced in Sylius-Standard or PluginSkeleton, I'd go with the deprecation path, similar to what we've done for the config files in `app/`. Since they're not, I think we can safely merge it.
