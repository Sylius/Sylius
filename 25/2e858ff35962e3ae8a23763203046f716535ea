You need to use the “twig” view with the `@BabDevPagerfanta/semantic_ui.html.twig` template to keep translation support.  The “semantic_ui” view is PHP generated without translation support.

This’ll also close https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/issues/12462 😉

@mbabker I updated this PR, is that ok for you?

For the package configuration, I think it's needed into the sylius/sylius-standard repository.
