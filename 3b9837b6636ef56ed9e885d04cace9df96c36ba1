@pamil @lchrusciel This is not a big one, tell me what you think about this? :)

@pamil yes :) I run them several times with or without specific translations.
Maybe we can add some tests on data fixtures by executing cli on behat like you do with installer.
Indeed, I think we have to ensure old methods are still working with other future changes.

@pamil I just see there are phpunit tests for data fixtures. I'm gonna look that.

@pamil as I said you on slack, I added some phpunit tests and some phpspec tests to ensure the two configs works and can coexist.

T-shirts are also an example of usage without translation.

Yes, cause t-shirts has no translation in french! But you're right, it's an example without translation.

@pamil @lchrusciel @Zales0123
I think this is just the beginning. As a next step, I think it could be cool to apply these custom translations with product fixtures and next with other translatable resources.
