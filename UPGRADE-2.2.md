# UPGRADE FROM `2.1` TO `2.2`

### Translations

1. The `TranslationLocaleProvider` now ensures that the default locale (configured as `locale` in `config/parameters.yaml`)
   is always placed at the beginning of the returned locales array.  
   Other locales remain in the same order as returned by the repository.
