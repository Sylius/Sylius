# UPGRADE FROM `v1.11.X` TO `v1.12.0`

## Main update

1. Service `sylius.twig.extension.taxes` has been deprecated. Use methods `getTaxExcludedTotal` and `getTaxIncludedTotal` 
   from `Sylius\Component\Core\Model\Order` instead.

2. Both `getCreatedByGuest` and `setCreatedByGuest` methods were deprecated on `\Sylius\Component\Core\Model\Order`. 
Please use `isCreatedByGuest` instead of the first one. The latter is a part of the `setCustomerWithAuthorization` logic 
and should be used only this way.

3. Due to refactoring constructor has been changed in service `src/Sylius/Bundle/ShopBundle/EventListener/OrderIntegrityChecker.php`:
    ```diff
      public function __construct(
        private RouterInterface $router,
        - private OrderProcessorInterface $orderProcessor,
        private ObjectManager $manager
        + private OrderPromotionsIntegrityCheckerInterface $orderPromotionsIntegrityChecker 
      )
    ```
