Contributing Patches and BDD Methodology
----------------------------------------

Sylius is an open source, community-driven project.

Sylius follows Behavior-Driven-Development practices and we suggest you
to read dedicated part which explains how we work.

You can learn [how to contribute the patches](http://docs.sylius.org/en/latest/contributing/code/patches.html)
and [how we use Behat & PHPSpec](http://docs.sylius.org/en/latest/contributing/code/bdd.html)
in two separate parts of our [Contributing Guide](http://docs.sylius.org/en/latest/contributing/index.html).

Security Issues
---------------

Sylius is not stable yet, but has been already used in production and we want
to treat security very seriously. I decided to partially adopt the Symfony
security procedures, you can read about it [here](http://docs.sylius.org/en/latest/contributing/code/security.html).
