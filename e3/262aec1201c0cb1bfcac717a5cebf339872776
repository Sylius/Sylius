Maybe we should add some logging ðŸ¤”. Usually when something goes wrong we throw an exception, but in this case when we want to be silent, let's let know the developer (or administrator) something happened ðŸ¤”?

WDYT @vvasiloi? Do you want to finish this PR (I promise to review it quicker this time ðŸ¤£), or should we take it over?
