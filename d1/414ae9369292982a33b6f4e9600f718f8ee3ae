I don't remember, what was a bug for the previous 3 versions, I can describe the current behavior only.

At the moment bug can be spotted on https://travis-ci.org/github/Sylius/Sylius/jobs/722721300#L1758 (two scenarios are failing).

The problem is as follows: if you try to review product without any data, then validation will work as expected:

with following validation calls:

If you, however, fill review related data (but omit email address) and submit form:

you will stay on the same page, but without any errors displayed. Probably due to different validation calls:

There is a clear difference in the validated field resolution(`[author]` vs `children[author]`), where we could clearly expect exactly the same behavior.

The issue is probably related to changes introduced somewhere here: https://github.com/symfony/form/compare/v4.4.8...v4.4.9 or https://github.com/symfony/form/commit/fa833d8726c11ced06b51e0d4350f5192cb92270#diff-d14286dfb8590b9989ecc626176b2759
