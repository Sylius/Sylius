It's because this problem isn't in 1.2. The shipping discount works as expected in 1.2 (even though there is the same line is in the code).

I'm sorry, you're right, it must be an error that started to happen after we fixed the percentage based promotions.

No problem :) I updated my branch with latest 1.3. All checks passed. Is it possible to merge now? Let me know if you need anything else to do.

Thanks.
