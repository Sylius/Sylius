        And the store ships everywhere for Free
        And the store allows paying Offline
        And the store has a product "Sylius T-Shirt"
        And this product has "Red XL" variant priced at "$40.00"
        And I am logged in as an administrator

    Scenario: Seeing statistics for the current year and default channel when expectations are not specified
