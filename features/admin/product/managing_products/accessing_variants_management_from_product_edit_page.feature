    As an Administrator

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And the store has a "Audi" configurable product
        And this product has option "Model" with values "RS6" and "RS7"
        And I am logged in as an administrator

    Scenario: Being able to access the variants list page
        When I modify the "Audi" product
        And I go to the variants list
        Then I should be on the list of this product's variants

    @ui
    Scenario: Being able to access the variant generation page
        When I modify the "Audi" product
