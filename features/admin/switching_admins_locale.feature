@admin_locale
Feature: Switching locales on admin's panel
    In order to see the panel in my preferred language
    As an Administrator
    I want to be able to switch locales

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel
        And that channel allows to shop using "English (United States)", "Spanish (Mexico)" and "Portuguese (Brazil)" locales
        And it uses the "English (United States)" locale by default
        And the locale "Portuguese (Brazil)" is disabled
        And I am logged in as an administrator
        And I am using "English (United States)" locale for my panel

    @ui
    Scenario: Changing my preferred locale
        Given I am editing my details
        When I set my locale to "Spanish (Mexico)"
        Then I should be viewing the administration panel in "Spanish (Mexico)"

    @ui
    Scenario: Admin's panel can be viewed in a disabled locale
        Given I am editing my details
        When I set my locale to "Portuguese (Brazil)"
        Then I should be viewing the administration panel in "Portuguese (Brazil)"

    @ui
    Scenario: Changing my preferred language to a locale that does not exist in the store
        Given the locale "French (France)" does not exist in the store
        And I am editing my details
        When I set my locale to "French (France)"
        Then I should be viewing the administration panel in "French (France)"

    @ui
    Scenario: Changing panel's locale doesn't change shop's locale
        Given I am editing my details
        When I set my locale to "Portuguese (Brazil)"
        Then I should still shop using the "English (United States)" locale

    @ui
    Scenario: Changing shop's locale has doesn't affect admin panel's locale
        Given I switched the shop's locale to "Spanish (Mexico)"
        When I open administration dashboard
        Then I should still be viewing the administration panel in "English (United States)"

    @ui
    Scenario: Locales are saved per each admin's preference
        Given I am using "Spanish (Mexico)" locale for my panel
        And there is an administrator "admin@example.com" identified by "sylius"
        And this administrator is using "Portuguese (Brazil)" locale
        When this administrator logs in using "sylius" password
        Then they should be viewing the administration panel in "Portuguese (Brazil)"
