Feature: Support categories management
    In order to improve customer support
    As a store owner
    I want to manage support ticket categories

    Background:
        Given store has default configuration
          And there are following support categories:
            | title               |
            | Order return        |
            | Delivery            |
            | Product information |
          And I am logged in as administrator

    Scenario: Browsing all support categories
        Given I am on the dashboard page
         When I follow "Configure categories"
         Then I should be on the support category index page
          And I should see 3 support categories in the list
          And I should see category with title "Order return" in the list

    Scenario: Seeing empty index of support categories
        Given there are no support categories
         When I am on the support category index page
         Then I should see "There are no support categories to display"

    Scenario: Accessing the support category creation form
        Given I am on the dashboard page
         When I follow "Configure categories"
          And I follow "Create support category"
         Then I should be on the support category creation page

    Scenario: Submitting the form without the title fails
        Given I am on the support category creation page
         When I press "Create"
         Then I should still be on the support category creation page
          And I should see "Please enter category title"

    Scenario: Creating new support category
        Given I am on the support category creation page
         When I fill in "Title" with "Product ticket"
          And I press "Create"
         Then I should be on the support category index page
          And I should see "Support category has been successfully created"
          And I should see category with title "Product ticket" in the list

    Scenario: Accessing the support category edit form
        Given I am on the support category index page
         When I click "edit" near "Order return"
         Then I should be editing support category with title "Order return"

    Scenario: Updating the support category title
        Given I am editing support category with title "Delivery"
          And I fill in "Title" with "Product delivery"
          And I press "Save changes"
         Then I should be on the support category index page
          And I should see support category with title "Product delivery" in the list

    Scenario: Deleting a support category
        Given I am on the support category index page
         When I press "delete" near "Delivery"
         Then I should still be on the support category index page
          And I should see "Support category has been successfully deleted"
          And I should not see support category with title "Delivery" in the list
