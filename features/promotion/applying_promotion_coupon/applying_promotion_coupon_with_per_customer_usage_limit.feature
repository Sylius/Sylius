Feature: Applying promotion coupon with per customer usage limit
    In order to pay proper amount after using the promotion coupon
    As a Customer
    I want to have promotion coupon's discounts applied to my cart only if the given promotion coupon is valid

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And the store has a product "PHP T-Shirt" priced at "$100.00"
        And the store has a product "PHP Socks" priced at "$30.00"
        And the store has promotion "Christmas sale" with coupon "SANTA2016"
        And this coupon can be used twice per customer
        And this promotion gives "$10.00" discount to every order
        And the store ships everywhere for free
        And the store allows paying "Cash on Delivery"
        And I am a logged in customer

    @ui @api
    Scenario: Receiving discount from valid coupon with a per customer usage limit as a logged in customer
        When I add product "PHP T-Shirt" to the cart
        And I use coupon with code "SANTA2016"
        Then my cart total should be "$90.00"
        And my discount should be "-$10.00"

    @ui @api
    Scenario: Receiving discount from valid coupon with a per customer usage limit as a logged in customer
        Given I placed an order "#00000022"
        And I bought a "PHP T-Shirt" and a "PHP Socks"
        And I used "SANTA2016" coupon
        And I chose "Free" shipping method to "United States" with "Cash on Delivery" payment
        When I add product "PHP T-Shirt" to the cart
        And I use coupon with code "SANTA2016"
        Then my cart total should be "$90.00"
        And my discount should be "-$10.00"

    @ui @api
    Scenario: Receiving no discount from valid coupon that has reached its per customer usage limit
        Given this coupon can be used once per customer
        And I placed an order "#00000022"
        And I bought a single "PHP T-Shirt" using "SANTA2016" coupon
        And I chose "Free" shipping method to "United States" with "Cash on Delivery" payment
        When I add product "PHP T-Shirt" to the cart
        And I use coupon with code "SANTA2016"
        Then I should be notified that the coupon is invalid
        And my cart total should be "$100.00"
        And there should be no discount

    @ui @api
    Scenario: Cancelled orders do not affect per customer usage limit by default
        Given this coupon can be used once per customer
        And I placed an order "#00000022"
        And I bought a single "PHP T-Shirt" using "SANTA2016" coupon
        And I chose "Free" shipping method to "United States" with "Cash on Delivery" payment
        But I cancelled this order
        When I add product "PHP T-Shirt" to the cart
        And I use coupon with code "SANTA2016"
        Then my cart total should be "$90.00"
        And my discount should be "-$10.00"

    @ui @api
    Scenario: Cancelled orders affect per customer usage limit
        Given this coupon is set as non reusable after cancelling the order in which it has been used
        And this coupon can be used once per customer
        And I placed an order "#00000022"
        And I bought a single "PHP T-Shirt" using "SANTA2016" coupon
        And I chose "Free" shipping method to "United States" with "Cash on Delivery" payment
        But I cancelled this order
        When I add product "PHP T-Shirt" to the cart
        And I use coupon with code "SANTA2016"
        Then I should be notified that the coupon is invalid
        And my cart total should be "$100.00"
        And there should be no discount
