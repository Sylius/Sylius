    As a Visitor
    I want to be able to add a simple product with stated quantity to the cart

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And the store has a product "T-Shirt banana" priced at "$12.54"

    @api @ui @javascript
    Scenario: Adding a product with stated quantity to the cart
        Given there are 10 units of product "T-Shirt banana" available in the inventory
        When I add 5 of them to my cart
        Then I should be on my cart summary page
        And I should be notified that the product has been successfully added
        And I should see "T-Shirt banana" with quantity 5 in my cart

    @todo-api @ui @javascript
    Scenario: Adding way too many products sets their quantity to 9999
        Given there are 100000 units of product "T-Shirt banana" available in the inventory
        When I try to add 20000 products "T-Shirt banana" to the cart
        Then I should be on "T-Shirt banana" product detailed page
        And I should be notified that the quantity of this product must be between 1 and 9999
