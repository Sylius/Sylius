@payment_request_notify
Feature: Calling notify for a payment method
    In order to process a payment request action related to a payment method
    As an external payment provider
    I want to be able to send HTTP request data to trigger a new payment request action

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And the store has a "PHP T-Shirt" product
        And the store ships everywhere for Free
        And the store has a payment method "Offline" with a code "offline"
        And there is a customer "john@example.com" that placed order with "PHP T-Shirt" product to "United States" based billing address with "Free" shipping method and "Offline" payment method


    @ui
    Scenario: I want to send HTTP request to the payment request notify and succeeded
        Given there is a "new" "notify" payment request for order "#000001" using the "Offline" payment method
        When I call the payment request notify page for this payment request
        Then a payment request with "notify" action and state "completed" should exists
        And the response status code should be 204
        And the response content should be empty

    @ui
    Scenario: I want to send HTTP request to the payment method notify and failed
        Given there is a "completed" "notify" payment request for order "#000001" using the "Offline" payment method
        When I call the payment request notify page for this payment request
        Then a payment request with "notify" action and state "completed" should exists
        And the response status code should be 404
