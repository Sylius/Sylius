    Scenario: Change title of a route
        Given the store has route "krzysztof-krawczyk" with "Ryszard Rynkowski" as its content
        And I want to edit this route
        When I choose "Krzysztof Krawczyk" as its new content
        And I save my changes
        Then I should be notified that it has been successfully edited
        And this route should have assigned "Krzysztof Krawczyk" content
