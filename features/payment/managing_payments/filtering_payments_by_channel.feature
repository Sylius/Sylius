Feature: Filtering payments by channel
    In order to browse only relevant payments
    As an Administrator
    I want to be able to filter payments from a specific channel on the list

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And the store operates on another channel named "Canada" in "CAD" currency
        And the store ships everywhere for free for all channels
        And the store allows paying offline for all channels
        And the store has a product "Apple" priced at "$100.00" in "United States" channel
        And the store has a product "Orange" priced at "$150.00" in "Canada" channel
        And there is an "#00000001" order with "Apple" product in "United States" channel
        And there is an "#00000002" order with "Orange" product in "Canada" channel
        And I am logged in as an administrator

    Scenario: Filtering payments by channel on index
        When I browse payments
        And I choose "Canada" as a channel filter
        And I filter
        Then I should see a single payment in the list
        And I should see the payment of the "#00000002" order
        But I should not see a payment of order "#00000001"
