        And the store has a payment method "Offline" with a code "offline"
        And I am logged in as an administrator

    Scenario: Trying to add a new payment method without specifying its code
        Given I want to create a new payment method
        When I name it "Paypal Express Checkout" in "English (United States)"
        But I do not specify its code
        And I choose "Paypal Express Checkout" gateway
        And I add it
        Then I should be notified that code is required
        And the payment method with name "Paypal Express Checkout" should not be added

        But I do not name it
        And I add it
        Then I should be notified that name is required
        And the payment method with code "PEC" should not be added

        Then I should be notified that name is required
        And this payment method should still be named "Offline"
