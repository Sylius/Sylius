Feature: Product archetype translations
    In order to create similar products faster
    As a store owner
    I want to be able to create archetypes with localised names

    Background:
        Given store has default configuration
          And there are following locales configured:
            | code  |
            | en_US |
            | es_ES |
          And I am logged in as administrator

    Scenario: Creating a product archetype requires default translation fields
        Given I am on the product archetype creation page
        And I fill in the following:
            | Code                                          | Shirt    |
            | sylius_product_archetype_translations_es_name | Camiseta |
        When I press "Create"
        Then I should still be on the product archetype creation page
        And  I should see "Please enter archetype name."

    Scenario: Creating a product in archetype specific locale
        Given I am on the product archetype creation page
        And I fill in the following:
            | Code                                          | Shirt    |
            | sylius_product_archetype_translations_es_name | Camiseta |
            | sylius_product_archetype_translations_en_name | Shirt    |
        When I press "Create"
        Then "Product archetype has been successfully created." should appear on the page
        And "es" translation for product archetype "Camiseta" should exist
        And "en" translation for product archetype "Shirt" should exist
