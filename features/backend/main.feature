Feature: Store dashboard
    In order to have an overview of my business
    As a store owner
    I need to be able to see sales info in backend dashboard

    Background:
        Given there is default currency configured
          And there is default channel configured
          And I am logged in as administrator
          And the following zones are defined:
            | name         | type    | members                       |
            | French lands | country | French, Austria, Switzerland  |
          And there are products:
            | name          | price |
            | Mug           | 5.99  |
          And the following orders were placed:
            | customer               | address                                                |

            | Mug  | 2        |

    Scenario: Viewing the dashboard logged in root
       Given I am on the dashboard
        Then I should see "Tableau de bord"
