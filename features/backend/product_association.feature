    Scenario: Create association type
       Given I want to create new association type
       When I create "Cross sell" association type
       Then I should be able to add "Cross sell" associations to any product

      @wip
    Scenario Outline: Associate product with others products
      Given there are following association types:
        | name       |
        | Cross sell |
        | Upsell     |
        | Different  |
      And I want to assign new association for "<Product name>" product
      When I select "<Associated product name>" product as "<Association type>" association
      Then I should see that "<Product name>" is connected with "<Associated product name>" by "<Association type>" association

      Examples:
        | Product name  | Associated product name | Association type |
        | Black T-Shirt | Super T-Shirt           |      Cross sell  |
        | Black T-Shirt | Mug                     |       Different  |
