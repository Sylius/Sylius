Feature: Zones
    As a store owner
    I want to be able to manage zones
    In order to apply taxes and allow shipping to geographical areas

    Background:
        Given I am logged in as administrator
          And there are following zones:
            | name                      | type     | members                                       |
            | Baltic states             | country  | Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia                    |
            | USA GMT-8                 | province | Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Idaho, California |
            | Baltic states + USA GMT-8 | zone     | Baltic states, USA GMT-8                      |
            | Germany                   | country  | Germany                                       |
