    As an Administrator
    I want to see aggregated taxes of a specific order

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And the store has "VAT" tax rate of 23% for "Standard US services" within the "US" zone
        And the store has "Low VAT" tax rate of 10% for "Lowered US services" within the "US" zone
        And the store has a product "Composite bow" priced at "$100.00"
        And it belongs to "Standard US services" tax category
        And the store has a product "Claymore" priced at "$50.00"
        And it belongs to "Lowered US services" tax category
        And the store has a product "Bastard sword" priced at "$150.00"
        And it belongs to "Lowered US services" tax category
        And the store has "DHL" shipping method with "$10.00" fee within the "US" zone
        And shipping method "DHL" belongs to "Standard US services" tax category
        And the store allows paying offline
        And there is a customer "charles.the.great@medieval.com" that placed an order "#00000001"
        And I am logged in as an administrator

    Scenario: Seeing aggregated taxes of products and shipping
        Given the customer bought a single "Composite bow"
        And the customer chose "DHL" shipping method to "United States" with "Offline" payment
        When I view the summary of the order "#00000001"
        Then there should be a shipping charge "DHL $10.00"
        And the order's shipping total should be "$12.30"
        And the order's tax total should be "$25.30"
        And the order's total should be "$135.30"
