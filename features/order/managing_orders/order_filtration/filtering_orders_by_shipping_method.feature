        And the store has a product "Red ElePHPant"
        And the store ships everywhere for Free
        But the store has "DHL" shipping method with "$10.00" fee
        And the store allows paying Offline

    Scenario: Filtering orders by DHL shipping method
        When I browse orders
        And I choose "DHL" as a shipping method filter
        And I filter
        Then I should see a single order in the list
        And I should see an order with "#000001338" number
        And I should not see an order with "#000001337" number

    @ui

        And I should see an order with "#000001337" number
        And I should see an order with "#000000042" number
