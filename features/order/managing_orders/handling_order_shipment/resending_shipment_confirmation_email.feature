    In order to be able to send a lost email again
    As an Administrator
    I want to have the shipment confirmation email for a chosen order sent to the customer

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And that channel allows to shop using "English (United States)" and "Polish (Poland)" locales
        And the store has a product "Angel T-Shirt"
        And the store ships everywhere for free
        And the store allows paying with "Cash on Delivery"
        And there is a customer "lucy@teamlucifer.com" that placed an order "#00000666"
        And the customer bought a single "Angel T-Shirt"
        And the customer "Lucifer Morningstar" addressed it to "Seaside Fwy", "90802" "Los Angeles" in the "United States" with identical billing address
        And the customer chose "Free" shipping method with "Cash on Delivery" payment
        And this order has already been shipped
        And I am logged in as an administrator
