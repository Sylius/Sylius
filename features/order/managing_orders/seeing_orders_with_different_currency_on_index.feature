Feature: Seeing orders' total in their currency
    In order to know how much, and in which currency a customer placed an order
    As an Administrator
    I want to be able to see orders' total in it's currency

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a channel named "United States" in "USD" currency
        And the store operates on another channel named "Great Britain" in "GBP" currency
        And the store ships to "United States"
        And the store has a zone "United States" with code "US"
        And this zone has the "United States" country member
        And the store ships everywhere for free for all channels
        And the store allows paying offline for all channels
        And the store has a product "Angel T-Shirt" priced at "$20.00" available in channel "United States" and channel "Great Britain"
        And there is an administrator "sylius@example.com" identified by "sylius"
        And there is a customer account "customer@example.com" identified by "sylius"
        And I am logged in as "customer@example.com"
