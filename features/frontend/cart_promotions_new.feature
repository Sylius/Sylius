Feature: Checkout product promotion
    In order to handle product promotions
    As a store owner
    I want to apply promotion discounts during checkout

    Background:
        Given store has default configuration
        And there are following taxonomies defined:
            | name     |
            | Category |
        And taxonomy "Category" has following taxons:
            | Clothing > Debian |
            | Clothing > Centos |
        And the following products exist:
            | name    | price | taxons |
            | Buzz    | 500   | Debian |
            | Potato  | 200   | Debian |
            | Woody   | 125   | Debian |
            | Sarge   | 25    | Centos |
            | Etch    | 20    | Centos |
            | Lenny   | 15    | Centos |
          And the following promotions exist:
            | name               | description     |
            | Discount on Debian | 50% Only Debian |
          And promotion "Discount on Debian" has following rules defined:
            | type             | configuration             |
            | Taxonomy         | Taxons: Debian,Exclude: 0 |
            And promotion "Discount on Debian" has following actions defined:
            | type                  | configuration  |
            | Percentage Discount   | Percentage: 50 |
          And all products are assigned to the default channel
          And all promotions are assigned to the default channel

    Scenario: Discount should not be applied if order contains no Debian products
        Given I have empty order
          And I add "3" product of "Sarge" type
         When I apply promotions
         Then I should have no discount
          And Total price should be 75.00

    Scenario: Discount should not be applied if order contains one Debian product
        Given I have empty order
          And I add "1" product of "Potato" type
         When I apply promotions
         Then I should have "50% Only Debian" discount equal -100
          And Total price should be 100.00

    Scenario: Discount should be applied to all Debian
              products if order contains more than one Debian product
        Given I have empty order
          And I add "2" product of "Potato" type
         When I apply promotions
         Then I should have "50% Only Debian" discount equal -200
          And Total price should be 200.00

    Scenario: Discount should be applied only to Debian
              products if the order contains not only Debian products
        Given I have empty order
          And I add "1" product of "Potato" type
          And I add "1" product of "Sarge" type
         When I apply promotions
#        For now it also discounts Sarge product
#         Then I should have "50% Only Debian" discount equal -100
#        And Total price should be 125.00
        Then I should have "50% Only Debian" discount equal -112.50
         And Total price should be 112.50
