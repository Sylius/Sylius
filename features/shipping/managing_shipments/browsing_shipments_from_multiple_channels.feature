        And the store has "UPS" shipping method with "$10.00" fee
        And the store has a product "Apple"
        And the store allows paying with "Cash on Delivery"
        And there is a customer "donald@duck.com" that placed an order "#00000001" in channel "united states"
        And the customer bought a single "Apple"
        And the customer "Donald Duck" addressed it to "Elm street", "90802" "Duckburg" in the "United States" with identical billing address

    Scenario: Browsing shipments and their states from multiple channels
        When I browse shipments
        And I should see 2 shipments in the list
        Then the shipment of the "#00000001" order should be "Shipped" for "donald@duck.com" in "United States" channel
        And the shipment of the "#00000003" order should be "Ready" for "iron@man.com" in "Canada" channel
