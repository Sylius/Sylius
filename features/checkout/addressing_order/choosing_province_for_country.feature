Feature: Choosing province for country
    In order to address an order properly
    As a Customer
    I want to be able to fill addressing details choosing country with provinces

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And country "United States" has the "New York" province with "NY" code
        And the store ships to "Nepal"
        And the store has a product "The Dark Knight T-Shirt" priced at "$49.99"
        And the store ships everywhere for Free
        And I am a logged in customer
