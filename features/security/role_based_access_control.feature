Feature: Hierarchical Role based access control (HRBAC)
  In order to restrict access to certain functionality
  As a Store Owner
  I want to be able to allow only certain roles to access backend

  Background:
    Given store has default configuration
      And authorization checks are enabled
      And there is following permission hierarchy:
        | code                  | parent         | description             |
        | sylius.catalog        |                | Manage products catalog |
        | sylius.product.show   | sylius.catalog | View single product     |
        | sylius.product.index  | sylius.catalog | List all products       |
        | sylius.product.create | sylius.catalog | Add new products        |
        | sylius.product.update | sylius.catalog | Edit products           |
        | sylius.product.delete | sylius.catalog | Delete products         |
        | sylius.sales          |                | Manage products sales   |
        | sylius.order.show     | sylius.sales   | View single order       |
        | sylius.order.index    | sylius.sales   | List all orders         |
        | sylius.order.create   | sylius.sales   | Add new orders          |
        | sylius.order.update   | sylius.sales   | Edit orders             |
        | sylius.order.delete   | sylius.sales   | Delete orders           |
      And there is following role hierarchy:
        | code                   | parent               | name            | security roles             |
        | sylius.administrator   |                      | Administrator   | ROLE_ADMINISTRATION_ACCESS |
        | sylius.catalog_manager | sylius.administrator | Catalog Manager | ROLE_ADMINISTRATION_ACCESS |
        | sylius.sales_manager   | sylius.administrator | Sales Manager   | ROLE_ADMINISTRATION_ACCESS |
      And role "Catalog Manager" has the following permissions:
        | sylius.catalog |
      And role "Sales Manager" has the following permissions:
        | sylius.sales |

  Scenario: Only selected menus are visible for Sales Manager
    Given I am logged in as "Sales Manager"
    When I go to the dashboard page
    Then I should not see "Products" in the menu
    But I should see "Orders" in the menu

  Scenario: Only selected menus are visible for Catalog Manager
    Given I am logged in as "Catalog Manager"
    When I go to the dashboard page
    Then I should not see "Orders" in the menu
    But I should see "Products" in the menu

  Scenario: Sales Manager cannot list products
    Given I am logged in as "Sales Manager"
    When I go to the product index page
    Then I should have my access denied

  Scenario: Sales Manager can list orders
    Given I am logged in as "Sales Manager"
    When I go to the order index page
    Then I should see "You have no new orders"

  Scenario: Catalog Manager can list products
    Given I am logged in as "Catalog Manager"
    When I go to the product index page
    Then I should see "There are no products"

  Scenario: Catalog Manager can create products
    Given I am logged in as "Catalog Manager"
    And I am on the product creation page
    When I fill in the following:
      | Name        | Book about Everything   |
      | Description | Interesting description |
      | Price       | 29.99                   |
    And I press "Create"
    Then I should be on the page of product "Book about Everything"
    And I should see "Product has been successfully created."

  Scenario: Sales Manager cannot create products
    Given I am logged in as "Sales Manager"
    When I go to the product creation page
    Then I should have my access denied
