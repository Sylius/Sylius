        And the store has locale "English (United States)"

    Scenario: Adding a new channel with menu taxon
        When I want to create a new channel
        And I specify its code as "MOBILE"
        And I name it "Mobile channel"
        And I choose "Euro" as the base currency
        And I choose "English (United States)" as a default locale
        And I select the "Order items based" as tax calculation strategy
        And I specify menu taxon as "Clothes"
        And I add it
        Then I should be notified that it has been successfully created
        And the channel "Mobile channel" should appear in the registry
        And the channel "Mobile channel" should have "Clothes" as a menu taxon
