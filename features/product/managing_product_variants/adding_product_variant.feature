    Scenario: Adding a new product variant
        Given I want to create a new variant of this product
        When I specify its code as "VODKA_WYBOROWA_PREMIUM"
        And I set its price to "$100.00"
        And I add it

        And the "VODKA_WYBOROWA_PREMIUM" variant of the "Wyborowa Vodka" product should appear in the shop
