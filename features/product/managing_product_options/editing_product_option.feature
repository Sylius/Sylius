    As an Administrator
    I want to be able to edit a product option

        Given the store is available in "English (United States)"
        And the store has a product option "T-Shirt size" with a code "t_shirt_size"
        And I am logged in as an administrator

    Scenario: Renaming the product option
        Given this product option has the "S" option value with code "t_shirt_size_s"
        And this product option has also the "M" option value with code "t_shirt_size_m"
        And I want to modify the "T-Shirt size" product option
        When I rename it to "T-Shirt color" in "English (United States)"
        And I save my changes
        Then I should be notified that it has been successfully edited
        And this product option name should be "T-Shirt color"
