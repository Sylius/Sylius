Feature: Removing a product's price after channel deletion
    In order to have product's prices specified only for existing channels
    As an Administrator
    I want to have product's price removed after corresponding channel deletion
    
    Background:
        Given the store has currency "USD"
        And the store has currency "GBP" with exchange rate 0.7
        And the store operates on a channel named "Web-US"
        And that channel uses the "USD" currency by default
        And the store operates on another channel named "Web-GB"
        And that channel uses the "GBP" currency by default
        And the store has a product "Dice Brewing" priced at "$10.00" for "Web-US" channel and "Â£5.00" for "Web-GB" channel
        And I am logged in as an administrator

    @ui @todog
    Scenario: Removing a product's price after corresponding channel deletion
        When I delete channel "Web-GB"
        Then product "Dice Brewing" should have price "$10.00" for channel "Web-US"
        And this product should no longer have price for channel "Web=GB"
