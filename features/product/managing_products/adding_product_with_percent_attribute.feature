    In order to extend my merchandise with more complex products
    As an Administrator
    I want to add a new product with a percent attribute to the shop

    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And the store has a percent product attribute "Awesomeness rating"
        And the store has a non-translatable percent product attribute "Accuracy"
        And I am logged in as an administrator

        When I want to create a new simple product
        And I specify its code as "44_MAGNUM"
        And I name it "44 Magnum" in "English (United States)"
        And I set its price to "$100.00" for "United States" channel
        And I set its "Awesomeness rating" attribute to "80" in "English (United States)"
        And I add it
        Then I should be notified that it has been successfully created
        And the product "44 Magnum" should appear in the store
        And attribute "Awesomeness rating" of product "44 Magnum" should be "80"
