        And the store operates on a channel named "Web"
        And I am logged in as an administrator

    Scenario: Configure channel and currency calculator while adding new simple product
        When I want to create a new simple product
        And I specify its code as "BOARD_DICE_BREWING"
        And I name it "Dice Brewing" in "English (United States)"
        And I choose "Channel and currency" calculator
        And I set its default price to "$20.00"
        And I set its price to "$10.00" for "USD" currency and "Web" channel
        And I set its slug to "dice-brewing"
        And I add it
        Then I should be notified that it has been successfully created
        And the product for "USD" currency and "Web" channel should be priced at "$10.00"
