Could you add a line to `UPGRADE-1.7.md` about this change? It's very unlikely, but it can be a BC break for some.

I'm on 1.3, and there are no `UPGRADE-1.7.md`... How that usually handled?

@igormukhingmailcom it should appear after you rebase your PR with the `master` branch - we can't merge it into any previous version (BC reasons), and even if we could, currently only 1.5+ versions are supported.

Hey Kamil.

Do we really need to add a notice to the UPGRADE file? According to our [bc promise](https://docs.sylius.com/en/1.6/contributing/code/bc.html#models-model-interfaces) we are fine without it :)

I would vote for merge ;)

> Models & model interfaces
> In order to fulfill the constant Syliusâ€™ need to evolve, model interfaces are excluded from this BC promise.

Rebased to 1.5
