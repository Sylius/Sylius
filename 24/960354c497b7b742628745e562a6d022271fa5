Is this bug reported to Symfony?

@pamil Nope. I didn't do that yet, I try to investigate what exactly is broken.
Maybe you suspect why it's not work properly?

And I guess that it should be opened on 1.7 branch

The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. **Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up.**

Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute `git fetch origin && git reset "fix-broken-build"` to update your local branch.

Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck :+1:
