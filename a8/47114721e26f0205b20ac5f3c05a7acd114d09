Could we make the "Taxes total" line grey when included in the price?

@kulczy & @CoderMaggie, as far as I know, the order can have both included and excluded taxes.
It's probably not something common, but it's technically possible.
Considering that, I think it's better to display the total of both types, then separately the subtotal for included and excluded. Or just the subtotal of included.

Since the Twig extensions in this PR will esentially introduce new public API, I would make these functions more strict in terms of I/O and their names more explicit.

Order tax: https://gist.github.com/vvasiloi/94afdcb3f082900db448c0fcba0fa591
Order items subtotal: https://gist.github.com/vvasiloi/474e5c5aaf201b2d8bf54605d479ba1d

P.S. Didn't test these.
