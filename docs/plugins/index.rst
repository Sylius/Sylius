Sylius Plugins
==============

Sylius as a platform has a lot of space for various customizations and extensions. It aims to provide a simple schema for
developing plugins. Anything you can imagine can be implemented and added to the Sylius framework as a plugin.


What are the plugins for?
-------------------------

The plugins either modify or extend Sylius default behaviour, providing useful features that
are built on top of the Sylius Core.

Exemplary features may be: Social media buttons, newsletter, wishlists, payment gateways integrations etc.
