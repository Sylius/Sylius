Sylius Plugins
==============

Sylius as a platform has a lot of space for various customizations and extensions. It aims to provide a simple schema for
developing plugins. Anything you can imagine can be implemented and added to the Sylius framework as a plugin.

What are the plugins for?
-------------------------

The plugins are Symfony Bundles that either modify or extend Sylius default behaviour, providing useful features that
are built on top of the Sylius Core.

Exemplary features may be: Social media buttons, newsletter, wishlists etc.

Plugin Development Flow
-----------------------

Since Sylius is an open-source platform, there is a certain flow in order for the plugin to become officially adopted by the community.

**1.** Develop the plugin using :doc:`the official Plugin Development guide </plugins/creating-plugin>`.

**2.** Send it to the project maintainers. It can be via email to any member of the Sylius Core team, or `the official Sylius Slack <http://sylius.org/slack>`_.

**3.** Wait for your Plugin to be featured in :doc:`the list of plugins </plugins/list>` here in the docs and on the Sylius website.
