Sylius API
==========

Unified API
-----------

.. warning::

    The new, unified Sylius API is still under development, that's why the whole ``ApiBundle`` is tagged with ``@experimental``.
    This means that all code from ``ApiBundle`` is excluded from :doc:`Backward Compatibility Promise </book/organization/backward-compatibility-promise>`.

This part of the documentation is about the currently developed unified API for the Sylius platform.
