Introduction to Sylius REST API
===============================

This part of the documentation is about RESTful JSON/XML API for the Sylius platform.

.. note::

    This documentation assumes you have at least some experience with `REST APIs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_.

.. tip::

   We strongly recommend starting with our basic guide to Sylius API in the Cookbook: ":doc:`How to use Sylius API? </cookbook/api/api>`".
