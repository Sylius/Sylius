How to start?
-------------

The first step is to create a new plugin using our ``PluginSkeleton``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer create-project sylius/plugin-skeleton IronManSyliusProductOnDemandPlugin

.. note::

    Remember about naming convention! Sylius plugin should start with your vendor name, followed by ``Sylius`` prefix and with ``Plugin`` suffix at the end.
    Let's say your vendor name is **IronMan**. Come on **IronMan**, let's create your plugin!
