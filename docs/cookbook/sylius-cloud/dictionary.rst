Sylius Cloud Dictionary
=======================

When diving into the Sylius Cloud, it's important to get familiar with some key terms. These terms help you navigate and understand how Sylius Cloud works.

- \- **Sylius Cloud Console** - a web-based interface that allows users to manage their projects, environments, applications, and services from a centralized dashboard. It provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface for performing various tasks related to application development, deployment, and management on the Sylius Cloud platform.

- \- **Sylius Cloud CLI** - the Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that allows users to interact with their Sylius Cloud projects, environments, applications, and services from the command line. It provides a set of commands and utilities that streamline common tasks related to application development, deployment, and management on the Sylius Cloud platform.

- \- **Project** - a container for all your environments, applications, and services. When you create a new project, you're essentially setting up a workspace where you can manage your development, staging, and production environments, along with the associated code repositories and services.

- \- **Environment** - a self-contained instance of your application that represents a specific stage in the software development lifecycle. Environments are used to separate different stages of development, testing, and production, allowing you to manage your application's codebase, configuration, and services in a controlled and isolated manner.

- \- **Build process** - the series of steps that are executed to prepare your application for deployment to a specific environment. These steps involve installing dependencies (Composer), warming-up application cache, building NodeJS assets, and performing any other tasks necessary to ensure that your application is ready to run in the target environment.

- \- **Deployment Process** - the process of replacing the existing application with the already built, updated version. The current application version is hosted until the whole deployment process exits without an error.

- \- **Relations** - the connections established between different services or components within your project. These connections enable communication and interaction between services, allowing them to work together seamlessly to support your application.
