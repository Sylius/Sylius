How to deploy Sylius to Platform.sh?
====================================

.. tip::

    Start with reading `Platform.sh documentation <https://docs.platform.sh/frameworks/symfony.html>`_.
    Also Symfony provides `a guide on deploying projects to Platform.sh <http://symfony.com/doc/current/deployment/platformsh.html>`_.

The process of deploying Sylius to Platform.sh is based on the guidelines prepared for Symfony projects in general.
In this guide you will find sufficient instructions to have your application up and running on Platform.sh.

1. Prepare a Platform.sh project
--------------------------------

* Create an account on `Platform.sh <https://platform.sh/>`_.

* Create a new project, name it (**MyFirstShop** for example) and select the **Blank project** template.

.. hint::

    **Platform.sh** offers a trial month, which you can use for testing your store deployment. If you would be asked to
    provide your credit card data nevertheless, use `this link <https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup>`_
    to create your new project.

* Install the Symfony-Platform.sh bridge in your application with ``composer require platformsh/symfonyflex-bridge``.

2. Make the application ready to deploy
---------------------------------------

* Create the ``.platform/routes.yaml`` file, which describes how an incoming URL is going to be processed by the server.

.. code-block:: yaml

    "https://{default}/":
        type: upstream
        upstream: "app:http"

    "https://www.{default}/":
        type: redirect
        to: "https://{default}/"

* Create the ``.platform/services.yaml`` file.

.. code-block:: yaml

    db:
        type: mysql:10.2
        disk: 2048

* Create the ``.platform.app.yaml`` file, which is the main server application configuration file (and the longest one ðŸ˜‰).

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: app
    type: php:7.3
    build:
        flavor: composer

    variables:
        env:
            # Tell Symfony to always install in production-mode.
            APP_ENV: 'prod'
            APP_DEBUG: 0

    # The hooks that will be performed when the package is deployed.
    hooks:
        build: |
            set -e
            yarn install
            GULP_ENV=prod yarn build
        deploy: |
            set -e
            rm -rf var/cache/*
            mkdir -p public/media/image
            bin/console sylius:install -n
            bin/console sylius:fixtures:load -n
            bin/console assets:install --symlink --relative public
            bin/console cache:clear

    # The relationships of the application with services or other applications.
    # The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed
    # to the application in the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable. The right-hand
    # side is in the form `<service name>:<endpoint name>`.
    relationships:
        # NOTE: this will install mariadb because platform.sh uses it instead of mysql.
        database: "db:mysql"

    dependencies:
        nodejs:
            yarn: "*"
            gulp-cli: "*"

    # The size of the persistent disk of the application (in MB).
    disk: 2048

    # The mounts that will be performed when the package is deployed.
    mounts:

        "/var/log": "shared:files/log"
        "/var/sessions": "shared:files/sessions"
        "/public/uploads": "shared:files/uploads"
        "/public/media": "shared:files/media"

    # The configuration of app when it is exposed to the web.
    web:

                root: "public"

                passthru: "/index.php"
                allow: true
                expires: -1
                scripts: true

.. warning::

    It is important to place the newly created file after importing regular parameters.yml file. Otherwise your database
    connection will not work. Also this will be the file where you should set your required parameters. Its value will
    be fetched from environmental variables.

The application secret is used in several places in Sylius and Symfony. Platform.sh allows you to deploy an environment
for each branch you have, and therefore it makes sense to have a secret automatically generated by the Platform.sh system.
The last 3 lines in the sample above will use the Platform.sh-provided random value as the application secret.

3. Add Platform.sh as a remote to your repository
-------------------------------------------------

Use the below command to add your Platform.sh project as the ``platform`` remote:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git remote add platform [PROJECT-ID]@git.[CLUSTER].platform.sh:[PROJECT-ID].git

The ``PROJECT-ID`` is the unique identifier of your project,
and ``CLUSTER`` can be ``eu`` or ``us`` - depending on where are you deploying your project.

4. Commit the configuration
---------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git add . && git commit -m "Platform.sh configuration"

5. Push your project to the Platform.sh remote repository
---------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git push platform master

The output of this command shows you on which URL your online store can be accessed.

6. Connect to the project via SSH and install Sylius
----------------------------------------------------

The SSH command can be found in your project data on Platform.sh. Alternatively use the
`Platform CLI tool <https://docs.platform.sh/gettingstarted/cli.html>`_.

When you get connected please run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php bin/console sylius:install --env prod

.. warning::

    By default platform.sh creates only one instance of the database with the ``main`` name.
    Platform.sh works with the concept of an environment per branch if activated. The idea is to mimic production settings per each branch.

7. Dive deeper
--------------

Add default Sylius cronjobs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the example below to your ``.platform.app.yaml`` file. This runs these cronjobs every 6 hours.

.. code-block:: yaml

    crons:
        cleanup_cart:
            spec: '0 */6 * * *'
            cmd: '/usr/bin/flock -n /tmp/lock.app.cleanup_cart bin/console sylius:remove-expired-carts --env=prod --verbose'
        cleanup_order:
            spec: '0 */6 * * *'
            cmd: '/usr/bin/flock -n /tmp/lock.app.cleanup_order bin/console sylius:cancel-unpaid-orders --env=prod --verbose'

Additional tips:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Platform.sh can serve gzipped versions of your static assets. Make sure to save your assets in the same folder, but with a .gz suffix.
  The ``gulp-gzip`` node package comes very helpful integrating saving of .gz versions of your assets.

* Platform.sh comes with a `New Relic integration <https://docs.platform.sh/administration/integrations/new-relic.html>`_.

* Platform.sh comes with a `Blackfire.io integration <https://docs.platform.sh/administration/integrations/blackfire.html>`_
