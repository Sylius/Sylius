How to deploy Sylius to Artifakt.com
====================================

1. What is Artifakt?
--------------------

`Artifakt <https://www.artifakt.com/>`_ is an all-in-one platform helping enterprises and developers fast-track deployments,
manage and run complex web applications on enterprise-grade cloud infrastructures on a global scale.

2. How does Artifakt work?
--------------------------

Artifakt provides a service based on Cloud technologies to help build, deploy, monitor, secure, and manage the scalability of your applications.

3. Create an Artifakt project
-----------------------------

To get off to a good start with Artifakt, you first need to create a project.

Click Create Project in the left menu and follow the steps to create your first project.
The project code must be unique within the workspace, you can refer to projects for more information.

In the second step, select the Sylius runtime and version that corresponds to the application you want to deploy.
Also, choose the `region <https://docs.artifakt.com/platform/available-regions>`_ where your application and data will be deployed.
When you create a project, you can use the default Artifakt code base for the chosen Sylius runtime, or you can link your own Git repository.
If you wish to use the Artifakt default code base, simply click "Skip, and Create Project". Otherwise, you can choose the location of your repository and choose your preferred repository and default branch.
If you did not link your Git repository during the project creation, you can do so afterwards by going to `Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environments` and clicking Link to a different repository so that you can then create environments using your application's source code.

.. hint::

    If you don't have an account on **Artifakt.com**, you should request a demo or contact support first.

4. Create an environment
------------------------

Once the project is created, you can create your first environment. To do so, go to your project and click on **New Environment**.
When creating an environment, you must define a name, the Git branch to deploy, the `type of platform <https://docs.artifakt.com/platform/platform-management>`_ to use, and the `criticality <https://docs.artifakt.com/platform/environment-lifecycle#environnement-et-criticite>`_ (environments can be either `critical` or `noncritical`).

If you set up your Git repository at the project level, the branches associated with your repository are automatically retrieved and available in the drop-down list.

5. Building the environment
---------------------------

Once your environment has been created, you can now launch its construction by clicking on **Build** in the drop-down menu.
You will then be redirected to the Overview page of the environment, from where you can follow the creation and start up of each service of the platform, in real time.

Once the environment is deployed and available online, a domain name generated by Artifakt will be displayed in the list of project environments and on the environment home page.

An Artifakt page will indicate that your environment's infrastructure has been created. You will then have to deploy your application source code when you are ready.
