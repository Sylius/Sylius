Customizing Repositories
========================

.. warning::
    In **Sylius** we are using both default Doctrine repositories and the custom ones.
    Often you will be needing to add your very own methods to them. You need to check before which repository is your resource using.

Why would you customize a Repository?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Different sets of different resources can be obtained in various scenarios in your application.
You may need for instance:

    * finding Orders by a Customer and a chosen Product
    * finding Products by a Taxon
    * finding Comments by a Customer

How to customize a Repository?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's assume that you would want to find products that are the bestsellers in your shop.

1. Create your own repository class under the ``AppBundle\Repository`` namespace.
Remember that it has to extend a proper base class. How can you check that?

For the ``ProductRepository`` run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console debug:container sylius.repository.product

As a result you will get the ``Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Doctrine\ORM\ProductRepository`` - this is the class that you need to be extending.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    namespace AppBundle\Repository;

    use Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Doctrine\ORM\ProductRepository as BaseProductRepository;

    class ProductRepository extends BaseProductRepository
    {
        /**
         * @param int $limit
         *
         * @return array
         */
        public function findBySold($limit = 4)
        {
            $queryBuilder = $this->createQueryBuilder('o');
            $queryBuilder
                ->addSelect('variant')
                ->addSelect('translation')
                ->leftJoin('o.variants', 'variant')
                ->leftJoin('o.translations', 'translation')
                ->addOrderBy('variant.sold', 'DESC')
                ->setMaxResults($limit)
            ;

            return $queryBuilder->getQuery()->getResult();
        }
    }

We are using the `Query Builder`_ in the Repositories.
As we are selecting Products we need to have a join to translations, because they are a translatable resource. Without it in the query results we wouldn't have a name to be displayed.

We are sorting the results by the count of how many times the product has been sold, which is being hold on the ``sold`` field on the specific ``variant`` of each product.
Then we are limiting the query to 4 by default, to get only 4 bestsellers.

2. In order to use your repository you need to configure it in the ``app/config/config.yml``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    sylius_product:
        resources:
            product:
                classes:
                    repository: AppBundle\Repository\ProductRepository

3. After configuring the ``sylius.product.repository`` service has your ``findBySold()`` method available.
You can form now on use your method in any **Controller**.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    public function bestsellersAction()
    {
        $productRepository = $this->container->get('sylius.repository.product');

        $bestsellers = $productRepository->findBySold();
    }

What happens while overriding Repositories?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The parameter ``sylius.repository.product.class`` contains ``AppBundle\Repository\ProductRepository``.
* The repository service ``sylius.repository.product`` is using your new class.
* Under the ``sylius.repository.product`` service you have got all methods from the base repository available plus the one you have added.
