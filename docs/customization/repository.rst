Customizing Repositories
========================

.. warning::
    In **Sylius** we are using both default Doctrine repositories and the custom ones.
    Often you will be needing to add your very own methods to them. You need to check before which repository is your resource using.

Why would you customize a Repository?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Different sets of different resources can be obtained in various scenarios in your application.
You may need for instance:

    * finding Orders by a Customer and a chosen Product
    * finding Products by a Taxon
    * finding Comments by a Customer

How to customize a Repository?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip::

    You can browse the full implementation of this example on `this GitHub Pull Request.
    <https://github.com/Sylius/Customizations/pull/5>`__

Let's assume that you would want to find products that you are running out of in the inventory.

**1.** Create your own repository class under the ``App\Repository`` namespace.
Remember that it has to extend a proper base class. How can you check that?

For the ``ProductRepository`` run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php bin/console debug:container sylius.repository.product

As a result you will get the ``Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Doctrine\ORM\ProductRepository`` - this is the class that you need to be extending.
To make your class more reusable, you should create a new interface ``src/Repository/ProductRepositoryInterface.php``
which will extend ``Sylius\Component\Core\Repository\ProductRepositoryInterface``

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace App\Repository;

    use Sylius\Component\Core\Repository\ProductRepositoryInterface as BaseProductRepositoryInterface;

    interface ProductRepositoryInterface extends BaseProductRepositoryInterface
    {
        public function findAllByOnHand(int $limit): array;
    }

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    namespace App\Repository;

    use Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Doctrine\ORM\ProductRepository as BaseProductRepository;

    class ProductRepository extends BaseProductRepository
    {
        public function findAllByOnHand(int $limit = 8): array
        {
            return $this->createQueryBuilder('o')
                ->addSelect('variant')
                ->addSelect('translation')
                ->leftJoin('o.variants', 'variant')
                ->leftJoin('o.translations', 'translation')
                ->addOrderBy('variant.onHand', 'ASC')
                ->setMaxResults($limit)
                ->getQuery()
                ->getResult()
            ;
        }
    }

We are using the `Query Builder`_ in the Repositories.
As we are selecting Products we need to have a join to translations, because they are a translatable resource. Without it in the query results we wouldn't have a name to be displayed.

We are sorting the results by the count of how many products are still available on hand, which is saved on the ``onHand`` field on the specific ``variant`` of each product.
Then we are limiting the query to 8 by default, to get only 8 products that are low in stock.

**2.** In order to use your repository you need to configure it in the ``config/packages/_sylius.yaml``.
As you can see in the ``_sylius.yaml`` you already have a basic configuration, now you just need to add your repository and override resourceRepository

.. code-block:: yaml

    sylius_product:
        resources:
            product:
                classes:
                ...
                    repository: App\Repository\ProductRepository
                ...

**3.** After configuring the ``sylius.repository.product`` service has your ``findByOnHand()`` method available.
You can now use your method in anywhere when you are operating on the Product repository.
For example you can configure new route:

.. code-block:: yaml

    app_shop_partial_product_index_by_on_hand:
    path: /partial/products/by-on-hand
    methods: [GET]
    defaults:
        _controller: sylius.controller.product:indexAction
        _sylius:
            template: '@SyliusShop/Product/_horizontalList.html.twig'
            repository:
                method: findAllByOnHand
                arguments: [4]
            criteria: false
        paginate: false
        limit: 100

What happens while overriding Repositories?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The parameter ``sylius.repository.product.class`` contains ``App\Repository\ProductRepository``.
* The repository service ``sylius.repository.product`` is using your new class.
* Under the ``sylius.repository.product`` service you have got all methods from the base repository available plus the one you have added.
