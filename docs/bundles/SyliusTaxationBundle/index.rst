SyliusTaxationBundle
====================

Calculating and applying taxes is a common task for most of ecommerce applications. **SyliusTaxationBundle** is a reusable taxation component for Symfony.
You can integrate it into your existing application and enable the tax calculation logic for any model implementing the ``TaxableInterface``.

It supports different tax categories and customizable tax calculators - you're able to easily implement your own calculator services.
The default implementation handles tax included in and excluded from the price.

As with any Sylius bundle, you can override all the models, controllers, repositories, forms and services.
