SyliusInventoryBundle
=====================

Flexible inventory management for Symfony applications.

With minimal configuration you can implement inventory tracking in your project.

It's fully customizable, but the default setup should be optimal for most use cases.

There is `StockableInterface` and `InventoryUnit` model inside the bundle.

There are services **AvailabilityChecker**, **InventoryOperator** and **InventoryChangeListener**.

You'll get familiar with them in later parts of this documentation.
