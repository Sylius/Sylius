How actions are applied ?
=========================

Everything related to this subject is located in ``Sylius\PromotionBundle\Action``.

Actions
-------

Actions can be created by implementing ``PromotionActionInterface``. This interface provides the method ``execute`` which aim is to apply a promotion to its subject. It also provides the method ``getConfigurationFormType`` which has to return the form name related to this action.

Actions have to be defined as services and have to use the tag named ``sylius.promotion_action`` with the attributes ``type`` and ``label``.

As ``SyliusPromotionBundle`` is totally independent, it does not provide some actions out of the box. Great examples of actions are provided by ``Sylius/Standard-Edition``.

.. note::

    ``Sylius\CoreBundle\Promotion\Action\FixedDiscountAction`` from ``Sylius/Standard-Edition`` is an example of action for a fixed amount discount. The related service is called ``sylius.promotion_action.fixed_discount``.
    
.. note::

    ``Sylius\CoreBundle\Promotion\Action\PercentageDiscountAction`` from ``Sylius/Standard-Edition`` is an example of action for a discount based on percentage. The related service is called  ``sylius.promotion_action.percentage_discount``.


All actions that you have defined as services will be automatically registered thanks to ``Sylius\PromotionBundle\Action\Registry\PromotionActionRegistry``.


Applying actions to promotions
------------------------------

We have seen above how actions can be created. Now let's see how they are applied to their subject. 

The ``PromotionApplicator`` is responsible of this via its method ``apply``. This method will ``execute`` all the registered actions of a promotion on a subject.
