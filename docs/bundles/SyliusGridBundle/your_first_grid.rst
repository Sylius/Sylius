Your First Grid
===============

In order to use grids, we need to register your entity as a Sylius resource. Let us assume you have a Supplier model in your application,
which represents a supplier of goods in your shop and has several fields, including name, description and enabled field.

In order to make it a Sylius resource, you need to configure it under ``sylius_resource`` node.
If you donâ€™t have it yet create a file ``app/config/resources.yml``, import it in the ``app/config/config.yml``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/resources.yml
    sylius_resource:
        resources:
            app.supplier:
                driver: doctrine/orm
                classes:
                    model: AppBundle\Entity\Supplier

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    imports:
        - { resource: "resources.yml" }

That's it! Your class is now a resource. In order to learn what does it mean, please refer to the :doc:`SyliusResourceBundle </bundles/SyliusResourceBundle/index>` documentation.

Grid Definition
---------------

Now we can configure our first grid:

.. note::

    Remember that a grid is **the way objects of a desired entity are displayed on its index view**. Therefore only fields that
    are useful for identification of objects are available - only ``string`` and ``twig`` type. Then even though a Supplier has also
    a description field, it is not needed on index and can't be displayed here.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/grids/admin/supplier.yml
    sylius_grid:
        grids:
            app_admin_supplier:
                driver:
                    name: doctrine/orm
                    options:
                        class: AppBundle\Entity\Supplier
                fields:
                    name:
                        type: string
                        label: sylius.ui.name
                    enabled:
                        type: twig
                        label: sylius.ui.enabled
                        options:
                            template: SyliusUiBundle:Grid/Field:enabled.html.twig # This will be a checkbox field

Remember to import your grid in the ``app/config/grids/grids.yml`` file which has to be imported in the ``app/config/config.yml``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/grids/grids.yml
    imports:
        - { resource: 'admin/supplier.yml' }

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    imports:
        - { resource: "grids/grids.yml" }

Generating The CRUD Routing
---------------------------

That's it. SyliusResourceBundle allows to generate a default CRUD interface including the grid we have just defined. Just put this in your routing configuration!

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing/admin/supplier.yml
    app_admin_supplier:
        resource: |
            alias: app.supplier
            section: admin
            templates: SyliusAdminBundle:Crud
            except: ['show']
            redirect: update
            grid: app_admin_supplier
            vars:
                all:
                    subheader: app.ui.supplier # define a translation key for your entity subheader
                index:
                    icon: 'file image outline' # choose an icon that will be displayed next to the subheader
        type: sylius.resource

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing/admin.yml
    app_admin_supplier:
        resource: 'supplier.yml'

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml
    app_admin:
        resource: 'routing/admin.yml'
        prefix: /admin

This will generate the following paths:

 * */admin/suppliers/* - [``GET``] - Your grid.
 * */admin/suppliers/new* - [``GET/POST``] - Creating new supplier.
 * */admin/suppliers/{id}/edit* - [``GET/PUT``] - Editing an existing supplier.
 * */admin/suppliers/{id}* - [``DELETE``] - Deleting specific supplier.
 * */admin/suppliers/{id}* - [``GET``] - Displaying specific supplier.

.. tip::

    `In the Semantic UI documentation <http://semantic-ui.com/elements/icon.html>`_ you can find all possible icons you can choose for your grid.

.. tip::

    See :doc:`how to add links to your new entity administration in the administration menu </customization/menu>`.

.. tip::

    Adding translations to the grid (read more :doc:`here </customization/translation>`):

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/Resources/translations/messages.en.yml
        app:
            ui:
                supplier: Supplier
                suppliers: Suppliers
            menu:
                admin:
                    main:
                        additional:
                            header: Additional
                            suppliers: Suppliers

After that your new grid should look like that when accessing the */admin/suppliers/new* path in order to create new object:

.. image:: ../../_images/grid_new.png
    :align: center

And when accessing index on the */admin/suppliers/* path it should look like that:

.. image:: ../../_images/grid.png
    :align: center

Defining Filters
----------------

In order to make searching for certain things in your grid you can use filters.

.. code-block:: yaml

    sylius_grid:
        grids:
            app_admin_supplier:
                    ...
                filters:
                    name:
                        type: string
                    enabled:
                        type: boolean

How will it look like in the admin panel?

.. image:: ../../_images/grid_filters.png
    :align: center

Default Sorting
---------------

You can define by which field you want the grid to be sorted and how.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/grids/admin/supplier.yml
    sylius_grid:
        grids:
            app_admin_supplier:
                    ...
                sorting:
                    name: asc
                    ...

Pagination
----------

You can limit how many items are visible on each page by providing an array of integers into the ``limits`` parameter.
The first element of the array will be treated as the default, so by configuring:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/grids/admin/supplier.yml
    sylius_grid:
        grids:
            app_admin_supplier:
                    ...
                limits: [30, 12, 48]
                ...

you will see thirty suppliers per page, also you will have the possibility to change the number of elements to either 12 or 48.

.. note::

    Pagination limits are set by default to 10, 25 and 50 items per page.
    In order to turn it off, configure `limits: ~`.

Actions Configuration
---------------------

Next step is adding some actions to the grid: create, update and delete.

.. note::

    There are two types of actions that can be added to a grid: ``main`` which "influence" the whole grid (like adding new objects)
    and ``item`` which influence one row of the grid (one object) like editing or deleting.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/grids/admin/supplier.yml
    sylius_grid:
        grids:
            app_admin_supplier:
                    ...
                actions:
                    main:
                        create:
                            type: create
                    item:
                        update:
                            type: update
                        delete:
                            type: delete

This activates such a view on the */admin/suppliers/* path:

.. image:: ../../_images/grid_full.png
    :align: center

Your grid is ready to use!
