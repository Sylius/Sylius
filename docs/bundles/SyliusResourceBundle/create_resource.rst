Creating Resources
==================

To display a form, handle its submission or to create a new resource via API,
you should use the **createAction** of your **app.controller.book** service.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml

    app_book_create:
        path: /books/new
        methods: [GET, POST]
        defaults:
            _controller: app.controller.book:createAction

Done! Now when you go to ``/books/new``, the ResourceController will use the factory (``app.factory.book``) to create a new book instance.
Then it will try to create an ``app_book`` form, and set the newly created book as its data.

Submitting the Form
-------------------

You can use exactly the same route to handle the submit of the form and create the book.

.. code-block:: html

    <form method="post" action="{{ path('app_book_create') }}">

On submit, the create action with method POST, will bind the request on the form, and if it is valid it will use the right manager to persist the resource.
Then, by default it redirects to ``app_book_show`` to display the created book, but you can easily change that behavior - you'll see this in further sections.

When validation fails, it will render the form just like previously with the error messages displayed.

Changing the Template
---------------------

Just like for the **show** and **index** actions, you can customize the template per route.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml

    app_book_create:
        path: /books/new
        methods: [GET, POST]
        defaults:
            _controller: app.controller.book:createAction
            _sylius:
                template: Book/create.html.twig

Using Custom Form
-----------------

You can also use custom form type on per route basis. Following Symfony3 conventions `forms types`__ are resolved by FQCN.
Below you can see the usage for specifying a custom form.

__ http://symfony.com/doc/current/forms.html#building-the-form

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml

    app_book_create:
        path: /books/new
        methods: [GET, POST]
        defaults:
            _controller: app.controller.book:createAction
            _sylius:
                form: AppBundle\Form\BookType

Passing Custom Options to Form
------------------------------

What happens when you need pass some options to the form?
Well, there's a configuration for that!

Below you can see the usage for specifying custom options, in this case, ``validation_groups``, but you can pass any option accepted by the form.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml

    app_book_create:
        path: /books/new
        methods: [GET, POST]
        defaults:
            _controller: app.controller.book:createAction
            _sylius:
                form:
                    type: app_book_custom
                    options:
                        validation_groups: [sylius, my_custom_group]

Using Custom Factory Method
---------------------------

By default, ``ResourceController`` will use the ``createNew`` method with no arguments to create a new instance of your object. However, this behavior can be modified.
To use a different method of your factory, you can simply configure the ``factory`` option.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml

    app_book_create:
        path: /books/new
        methods: [GET, POST]
        defaults:
            _controller: app.controller.book:createAction
            _sylius:
                factory: createNewWithAuthor

Additionally, if you want to provide your custom method with arguments from the request, you can do so by adding more parameters.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml

    app_book_create:
        path: /books/{author}/new
        methods: [GET, POST]
        defaults:
            _controller: app.controller.book:createAction
            _sylius:
                factory:
                    method: createNewWithAuthor
                    arguments: [$author]

With this configuration, ``$factory->createNewWithAuthor($request->get('author'))`` will be called to create new resource within the ``createAction``.

Custom Redirect After Success
-----------------------------

By default the controller will try to get the id of the newly created resource and redirect to the "show" route.
You can easily change that behaviour.
For example, to redirect to the index list after successfully creating a new resource - you can use the following configuration.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml

    app_book_create:
        path: /books/new
        methods: [GET, POST]
        defaults:
            _controller: app.controller.book:createAction
            _sylius:
                redirect: app_book_index

You can also perform more complex redirects, with parameters. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml

    app_book_create:
        path: /genre/{genreId}/books/new
        methods: [GET, POST]
        defaults:
            _controller: app.controller.book:createAction
            _sylius:
                redirect:
                    route: app_genre_show
                    parameters: { id: $genreId }

In addition to the request parameters, you can access some of the newly created objects properties, using the ``resource.`` prefix.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml

    app_book_create:
        path: /books/new
        methods: [GET, POST]
        defaults:
            _controller: app.controller.book:createAction
            _sylius:
                redirect:
                    route: app_book_show
                    parameters: { title: resource.title }

With this configuration, the ``title`` parameter for route ``app_book_show`` will be obtained from your newly created book.

Configuration Reference

                redirect:
                    route: app_book_show
                    parameters: { title: resource.title }
