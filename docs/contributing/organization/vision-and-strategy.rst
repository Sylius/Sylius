Vision & Strategy
=================

Vision & strategy is defined by the Project Leader, Core Team and Community members.

If you would like to suggest new tool, process, feel free to submit a PR to this section of the documentation.

GitHub
------

We use GitHub as the main tool to organize the community work and everything that happens around Sylius.
Releases, bug reports, feature requests, roadmap management, etc. happens on this platform.

If you are not sure about your issue, please use Slack to discuss it with the fellow community members before opening it on GitHub.

Milestones
~~~~~~~~~~

Since stable Sylius release, we use milestones to mark the lowest branch an issue or a PR applies to.
For example, if a bug report is marked with 1.0 milestone, the related bugfix PR should be opened against
1.0 branch. Then, after this PR is merged, it would be released in the next 1.0.x release.
