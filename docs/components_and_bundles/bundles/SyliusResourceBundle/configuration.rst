Configuring Your Resources
==========================

Now you need to configure your first resource. Let's assume you have a *Book* entity in your application and it has simple fields:

* id
* title
* author
* description

.. tip::

    You can see a full exemplary configuration of a typical resource
    :doc:`here, in the "How to add a custom model?" cookbook </cookbook/entities/custom-model>`.

Implement the ResourceInterface in your model class.
----------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    namespace App\Entity;

    use Sylius\Component\Resource\Model\ResourceInterface;

    class Book implements ResourceInterface
    {
        // Most of the time you have the code below already in your class.
        protected $id;

        public function getId()
        {
            return $this->id;
        }
    }

Configure the class as a resource.
----------------------------------

In your ``config/packages/sylius_resource.yaml`` add:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sylius_resource:
        resources:
            app.book:
                classes:
                    model: App\Entity\Book

That's it! Your Book entity is now registered as Sylius Resource.

You can also configure several doctrine drivers.
------------------------------------------------

.. note::

    Remember that the ``doctrine/orm`` driver is used by default.

.. code-block:: yaml

    sylius_resource:
        drivers:
            - doctrine/orm
            - doctrine/phpcr-odm
        resources:
            app.book:
                classes:
                    model: App\Entity\Book
            app.article:
                driver: doctrine/phpcr-odm
                classes:
                    model: App\Document\ArticleDocument

Generate API routing.
---------------------

.. tip::

    Learn more about using Sylius REST API in these articles:
    :doc:`REST API Reference </api/index>`, :doc:`How to use Sylius API? - Cookbook </cookbook/api/api>`.

Add the following lines to ``config/routes.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    app_book:
        resource: |
            alias: app.book
        type: sylius.resource_api

After that a full JSON/XML CRUD API is ready to use.
Sounds crazy? Spin up the built-in server and give it a try:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php bin/console server:run

You should see something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    Server running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

Now, in a separate Terminal window, call these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Lord of The Rings", "author": "J. R. R. Tolkien", "description": "Amazing!"}' http://localhost:8000/books/
   $ curl -i -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8000/books/

As you can guess, other CRUD actions are available through this API.

Generate web routing.
---------------------

What if you want to render HTML pages? That's easy! Update the routing configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    app_book:
        resource: |
            alias: app.book
        type: sylius.resource

This will generate routing for HTML views.

Run the ``debug:router`` command to see available routes:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php bin/console debug:router

    ------------------------ --------------- -------- ------ -------------------------
    Name                     Method          Scheme   Host   Path
    ------------------------ --------------- -------- ------ -------------------------
    app_book_show            GET             ANY      ANY    /books/{id}
    app_book_index           GET             ANY      ANY    /books/
    app_book_create          GET|POST        ANY      ANY    /books/new
    app_book_update          GET|PUT|PATCH   ANY      ANY    /books/{id}/edit
    app_book_delete          DELETE          ANY      ANY    /books/{id}

.. tip::

    Do you need **views** for your newly created entity? Read more about :doc:`Grids </components_and_bundles/bundles/SyliusGridBundle/index>`,
    which are a separate bundle of Sylius, but may be very useful for views generation.

You can configure more options for the routing generation but you can also define each route manually to have it fully configurable.
