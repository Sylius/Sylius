SyliusGridBundle
================

Displaying a grid with sorting and filtering options is a common task for many web applications. This bundle integrates the Sylius Grid component with the Symfony framework and allows you to display grids really easily.

Some of the features worth mentioning:

* Uses YAML to define the grid structure
* Supports different data sources: Doctrine ORM/ODM, native SQL query.
* Rich filter functionality, easy to define your own filter type with flexible form
* Each column type is configurable and you can create your own
* Automatic sorting
