   We're sorry but **this documentation section is outdated**. Please have that in mind when trying to use it.
   You can help us making documentation up to date via Sylius Github. Thank you!

We assume you're familiar with `Composer <http://packagist.org>`_, a dependency manager for PHP.
Use following command to add the component to your `composer.json` and download package.

If you have `Composer installed globally <http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer require sylius/grid

Otherwise you have to download .phar file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar require sylius/grid
