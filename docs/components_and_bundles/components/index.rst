Sylius Components Documentation
===============================

.. danger::

   We're sorry but **this documentation section is outdated**. Please have that in mind when trying to use it.
   You can help us making documentation up to date via Sylius Github. Thank you!

We provide a set of well-tested and decoupled PHP libraries.

The components are the foundation of the Sylius platform, but they can also
be used standalone with any PHP application even if you use a framework different than Symfony.

These packages solve common E-Commerce and web application problems. Have a look around this documentation to see if you will find them useful!

We recommend checking out :doc:`/components_and_bundles/components/general/index`, which will get you started in minutes.
