Basic Usage
===========

.. danger::

   We're sorry but **this documentation section is outdated**. Please have that in mind when trying to use it.
   You can help us making documentation up to date via Sylius Github. Thank you!

In all examples is used an exemplary class implementing **ShippableInterface**, which looks like:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    declare(strict_types=1);
    
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShippableInterface;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShippingCategoryInterface;

    class Wardrobe implements ShippableInterface
    {
        /**
         * @var ShippingCategoryInterface
         */
        private $category;

        /**
         * @var float
         */
        private $weight;

        /**
         * @var float
         */
        private $volume;

        /**
         * @var float
         */
        private $width;

        /**
         * @var float
         */
        private $height;

        /**
         * @var float
         */
        private $depth;

        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function getShippingWeight(): float
        {
            return $this->weight;
        }

        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function setShippingWeight(float $weight): void
        {
            $this->weight = $weight;
        }

        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function getShippingVolume(): float
        {
            return $this->volume;
        }

        /**
         * @param int $volume
         */
        public function setShippingVolume(float $volume)
        {
            $this->volume = $volume;
        }

        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function getShippingWidth(): float
        {
            return $this->width;
        }


        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function setShippingWidth(float $width)
        {
            $this->width = $width;
        }
        
        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function getShippingHeight(): float
        {
            return $this->height;
        }
        
        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function setShippingHeight(float $height)
        {
            $this->height = $height;
        }
        
        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function getShippingDepth(): float
        {
            return $this->depth;
        }
        
        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function setShippingDepth(float $depth)
        {
            $this->depth = $depth;
        }
        
        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function getShippingCategory(): ShippingCategoryInterface
        {
            return $this->category;
        }
        
        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function setShippingCategory(ShippingCategoryInterface $category)
        {
            $this->category = $category;
        }
    }

Shipping Category
-----------------

Every shipping category has three identifiers, an ID, code and name. You can access those by calling ``->getId()``, ``->getCode()`` and ``->getName()``
methods respectively. The name is mutable, so you can change them by calling and ``->setName('Regular')`` on the shipping category instance.

Shipping Method
---------------

Every shipping method has three identifiers, an ID code and name. You can access those by calling ``->getId()``, ``->getCode()`` and ``->getName()``
methods respectively. The name is mutable, so you can change them by calling  ``->setName('FedEx')`` on the shipping method instance.

Setting Shipping Category
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every shipping method can have shipping category. You can simply set or unset it by calling ``->setCategory()``.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShippingMethod;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShippingCategory;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShippingMethodInterface;

    $shippingCategory = new ShippingCategory();
    $shippingCategory->setName('Regular'); // Regular weight items

    $shippingMethod = new ShippingMethod();
    $shippingMethod->setCategory($shippingCategory); //default null, detach
    $shippingMethod->getCategory(); // Output will be ShippingCategory object
    $shippingMethod->setCategory(null);


Shipping Method Translation
---------------------------

**ShippingMethodTranslation** allows shipping method's name translation according to given locales. To see how to use translation please go to :ref:`component_resource_translations_usage`.


Shipment Item
-------------

You can use a **ShippingItem** for connecting a shippable object with a proper **Shipment**.
Note that a **ShippingItem** can exist without a **Shipment** assigned.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\Shipment;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShipmentItem;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShipmentInterface;

    $shipment = new Shipment();
    $wardrobe = new Wardrobe();
    $shipmentItem = new ShipmentItem();

    $shipmentItem->setShipment($shipment);
    $shipmentItem->getShipment(); // returns shipment object
    $shipmentItem->setShipment(null);

    $shipmentItem->setShippable($wardrobe);
    $shipmentItem->getShippable(); // returns shippable object

    $shipmentItem->getShippingState(); // returns const STATE_READY
    $shipmentItem->setShippingState(ShipmentInterface::STATE_SOLD);

Shipment
--------

Every **Shipment** can have the types of state defined in the **ShipmentInterface** and the **ShippingMethod**,
which describe the way of delivery.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShippingMethod;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\Shipment;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShipmentInterface;

    $shippingMethod = new ShippingMethod();

    $shipment = new Shipment();
    $shipment->getState(); // returns const checkout
    $shipment->setState(ShipmentInterface::STATE_CANCELLED);

    $shipment->setMethod($shippingMethod);
    $shipment->getMethod();

Adding shipment item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add many shipment items to shipment, which connect shipment with shippable object.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\Shipment;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShipmentItem;

    $shipmentItem = new ShipmentItem();
    $shipment = new Shipment();

    $shipment->addItem($shipmentItem);
    $shipment->hasItem($shipmentItem); // returns true
    $shipment->getItems(); // returns collection of shipment items
    $shipment->getShippingItemCount(); // returns 1
    $shipment->removeItem($shipmentItem);

Tracking shipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also define tracking code for your shipment:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\Shipment;

    $shipment->isTracked();// returns false
    $shipment->setTracking('5346172074');
    $shipment->getTracking(); // returns 5346172074
    $shipment->isTracked();// returns true

.. _component_shipping_checker-rule-checker-interface:

RuleCheckerInterface
--------------------

This example shows how use an exemplary class implementing **RuleCheckerInterface**.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\Shipment;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShipmentItem;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\Rule;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Checker\ItemCountRuleChecker;

    $rule = new Rule();
    $rule->setConfiguration(array('count' => 5, 'equal' => true));

    $wardrobe = new Wardrobe();

    $shipmentItem = new ShipmentItem();
    $shipmentItem->setShippable($wardrobe);

    $shipment = new Shipment();
    $shipment->addItem($shipmentItem);

    $ruleChecker = new ItemCountRuleChecker();
    $ruleChecker->isEligible($shipment, $rule->getConfiguration()); // returns false, because
    // quantity of shipping item in shipment is smaller than count from rule's configuration

.. hint::
    You can read more about each of the available checkers in the :doc:`checkers` chapter.

Delegating calculation to correct calculator instance
-----------------------------------------------------

**DelegatingCalculator** class delegates the calculation of charge for particular shipping subject to a correct calculator instance,
based on the name defined on the shipping method. It uses **ServiceRegistry** to keep all calculators registered inside
container. The calculators are retrieved by name.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShippingMethod;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Calculator\DefaultCalculators;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Calculator\PerItemRateCalculator;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Calculator\FlexibleRateCalculator;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\Shipment;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShipmentItem;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Calculator\DelegatingCalculator;
    use Sylius\Component\Registry\ServiceRegistry;

    $configuration = array(
        'first_item_cost'       => 1000,
        'additional_item_cost'  => 200,
        'additional_item_limit' => 2
    );
    $shippingMethod = new ShippingMethod();
    $shippingMethod->setConfiguration($configuration);
    $shippingMethod->setCalculator(DefaultCalculators::FLEXIBLE_RATE);

    $shipmentItem = new ShipmentItem();

    $shipment = new Shipment();
    $shipment->setMethod($shippingMethod);
    $shipment->addItem($shipmentItem);

    $flexibleRateCalculator = new FlexibleRateCalculator();
    $perItemRateCalculator = new PerItemRateCalculator();

    $calculatorRegistry = new ServiceRegistry(CalculatorInterface::class);
    $calculatorRegistry->register(DefaultCalculators::FLEXIBLE_RATE, $flexibleRateCalculator);
    $calculatorRegistry->register(DefaultCalculators::PER_ITEM_RATE, $perItemRateCalculator);

    $delegatingCalculators = new DelegatingCalculator($calculatorRegistry);
    $delegatingCalculators->calculate($shipment); // returns 1000

    $configuration2 = array('amount' => 200);
    $shippingMethod2 = new ShippingMethod();
    $shippingMethod2->setConfiguration($configuration2);
    $shippingMethod2->setCalculator(DefaultCalculators::PER_ITEM_RATE);

    $shipment->setMethod($shippingMethod2);
    $delegatingCalculators->calculate($shipment); // returns 200

.. caution::
       The method ``->register()`` and  ``->get()`` used in ``->calculate`` throw `InvalidArgumentException`_.
       The method ``->calculate`` throws `UndefinedShippingMethodException`_ when given shipment does not have a shipping method defined.

.. hint::
    You can read more about each of the available calculators in the :doc:`calculators` chapter.

Resolvers
---------

.. _method-resolver:

ShippingMethodsResolver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sylius has flexible system for displaying the shipping methods available for given shippables (subjects which implement
**ShippableInterface**), which is base on **ShippingCategory** objects and category requirements. The requirements are constant
default defined in **ShippingMethodInterface**. To provide information about the number of allowed methods it use **ShippingMethodResolver**.

First you need to create a few instances of **ShippingCategory** class:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShippingCategory;

    $shippingCategory = new ShippingCategory();
    $shippingCategory->setName('Regular');
    $shippingCategory1 = new ShippingCategory();
    $shippingCategory1->setName('Light');

Next you have to create a repository w which holds a few instances of **ShippingMethod**. An InMemoryRepository,
which holds a collection of **ShippingMethod** objects, was used. The configuration is shown below:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    // ...
    // notice:
    // $categories = array($shippingCategory, $shippingCategory1);

    $firstMethod = new ShippingMethod();
    $firstMethod->setCategory($categories[0]);

    $secondMethod = new ShippingMethod();
    $secondMethod->setCategory($categories[1]);

    $thirdMethod = new ShippingMethod();
    $thirdMethod->setCategory($categories[1]);
    // ...

Finally you can create a method resolver:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShippingCategory;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\Shipment;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\ShipmentItem;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Model\RuleInterface;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Checker\Registry\RuleCheckerRegistry;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Checker\ItemCountRuleChecker;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Resolver\ShippingMethodsResolver;
    use Sylius\Component\Shipping\Checker\ShippingMethodEligibilityChecker;

    $ruleCheckerRegistry = new RuleCheckerRegistry();
    $methodEligibilityChecker = new shippingMethodEligibilityChecker($ruleCheckerRegistry);

    $shippingRepository = new InMemoryRepository(); //it has collection of shipping methods

    $wardrobe = new Wardrobe();
    $wardrobe->setShippingCategory($shippingCategory);
    $wardrobe2 = new Wardrobe();
    $wardrobe2->setShippingCategory($shippingCategory1);

    $shipmentItem = new ShipmentItem();
    $shipmentItem->setShippable($wardrobe);
    $shipmentItem2 = new ShipmentItem();
    $shipmentItem2->setShippable($wardrobe2);

    $shipment = new Shipment();
    $shipment->addItem($shipmentItem);
    $shipment->addItem($shipmentItem2);

    $methodResolver = new ShippingMethodsResolver($shippingRepository, $methodEligibilityChecker);
    $methodResolver->getSupportedMethods($shipment);

The ``->getSupportedMethods($shipment)`` method return the number of methods allowed for shipment object.
There are a few possibilities:

1. All shippable objects and all ShippingMethod have category *Regular*. The returned number will be 3.

2. All ShippingMethod and one shippable object have category *Regular*. Second shippable object has category *Light*. The returned number will be 3.

3. Two ShippingMethod and one shippable object have category *Regular*. Second shippable object and one ShippingMethod have category *Light*. The returned number will be 3.

4. Two ShippingMethod and one shippable object have category *Regular*. Second shippable object and second ShippingMethod have category *Light*. The second Shipping category sets the category requirements as CATEGORY_REQUIREMENT_MATCH_NONE. The returned number will be 2.

5. Two ShippingMethod and all shippable objects have category *Regular*. Second ShippingMethod has category *Light*. The second Shipping category sets the category requirements as CATEGORY_REQUIREMENT_MATCH_NONE. The returned number will be 3.

6. Two ShippingMethod and one shippable object have category *Regular*. Second shippable object and second ShippingMethod have category *Light*. The second Shipping category sets the category requirements as CATEGORY_REQUIREMENT_MATCH_ALL. The returned number will be 2.

7. Two ShippingMethod have category *Regular*. All shippable object and second ShippingMethod have category *Light*. The second Shipping category sets the category requirements as CATEGORY_REQUIREMENT_MATCH_ALL. The returned number will be 1.

.. note::
    The categoryRequirement property in  **ShippingMethod** is set default to CATEGORY_REQUIREMENT_MATCH_ANY.
    For more detailed information about requirements please go to :doc:`/components_and_bundles/bundles/SyliusShippingBundle/shipping_requirements`.
