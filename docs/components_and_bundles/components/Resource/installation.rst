Installation
============

We assume you're familiar with `Composer <http://packagist.org>`_, a dependency manager for PHP.
Use following command to add the component to your `composer.json` and download package.

If you have `Composer installed globally <http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require sylius/resource

Otherwise you have to download .phar file.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar require sylius/resource
