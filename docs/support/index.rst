Support
=======

Besides documentation we have a very friendly community which provides support for all Sylius users seeking help!

At Sylius we have 3 main channels for communication and support.

Slack
-----

Most of us use Slack for their online communication with co-workers. We know that it is not convenient to have another chat window open,
therefore we've chosen Slack for the live communication with the community. Slack is supposed to handle the most urgent questions
in the fastest way possible.

The most important rooms for newcomers are:

#general - for discussions about Sylius development itself,
#docs - for discussions related to the documentation,
#support - for asking questions and helping others,
#random - for the non-work banter and water cooler conversation.

But there are many more specific channels also.
If you have any suggestions regarding its organization, please let us know on Slack!

Slack requires inviting new members, but this can be done automatically, just go to `sylius.com/slack <http://sylius.com/slack>`_,
enter your email and you will get an invitation.
If possible, please use your GitHub username - it will help us to recognize each other easily!

Forum
-----

In response to the rapid growth of our Ecosystem, we decided it is necessary to launch a brand new platform for support
and exchanging experience. On the contrary to Slack, our Forum is much easier to follow, on Slack unless you are a part
of the discussion when it is happening, it might be difficult to catch up when you have been offline.
Forum has a search engine so it is convenient to browse for what is interesting for you.

The Sylius Community Forum is meant for everyone who is interested in eCommerce technology and Sylius. We invite both existing
and new community members to join the discussion and help shape the ecosystem, products & services we are building.
Get to know other community members, ask for support, suggest an improvement or discuss your challenge.

You can register via email, Twitter & GitHub by going to `https://forum.sylius.com/ <https://forum.sylius.com/>`_ and hitting the “Sign-Up” button.

StackOverflow
-------------

We also encourage asking Sylius related questions on the `stackoverflow.com <http://stackoverflow.com>`_ platform.

* Search for the question before asking, maybe someone has already solved your problem,
* Be specific about your question, this is what SO is about, concrete questions and solutions,
* Be sure to tag them with **sylius** tag - it will make it easier to find for people who can answer it.
* Try also tagging your questions with the **symfony** tag - the Symfony community is very big and might be really helpful with
  Sylius related questions, as we are basing on Symfony.

To view all Sylius related questions - visit `this link <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sylius>`_.
You can also `search for phrase <http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&q=sylius>`_.
