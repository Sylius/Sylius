Deployment
==========

Development usually takes most of the time in project implementation, but we should not forget about what's at the end of this process -
application deployment into the server. We believe, that it should be as easy and understandable as possible.
There are many servers which you can choose for your store deployment: in our documentation you will find an easy Platform.sh guide.

Check it out!
