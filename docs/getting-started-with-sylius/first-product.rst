First product
=============

We move to one of the most important sections of the Admin panel - products management. As you can see, **Catalog** section the menu
is quite extended, but we will, for now, focus on product creation only. You can pick a *simple* or *configurable* product
type before its creation. Making a long story short - *simple* can be sold as only one variation, *configurable* as multiple of them.
Check out the :doc:`Products </book/products/products>` chapter in **The Book** for more information.

During the product creation, you can decide about many of its traits. How much does it cost? Is it a physical product that requires
shipping? Should it be tracked within the system? On which channel it will be available? Should it have some taxes added during
the checkout or not? Take a while to explore these options later, right now let's fill only the most critical data:

Summary
-------

Great, the first stage is done! You're not able to test the checkout process to see how customers would be able to buy products
in your brand new online store. The whole checkout process is described in :doc:`this part of the documentation </book/orders/checkout>`,
but it's quite natural and logical, so it should not be a problem to understand it.

We can now move to some more advanced parts of the tutorial - Sylius features customization and deploying it into the server,
to make it available for the world.
