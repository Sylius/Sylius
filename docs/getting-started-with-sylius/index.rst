This tutorial is dedicated to Sylius newcomers, who want to quickly check our system out - see basic configuration,
do some small customizations, and be able to sell the first products in their new webshop. It shows the quickest
and simplest way from an idea ("I want to sell some stuff online") to the first results ("I can sell some stuff online!").

.. warning::

    Be aware, that this guide is written for developers! To understand every chapter correctly, you need to have
    at least a foggy idea about object-oriented programming and PHP language.
    `Symfony <https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html>`_ experience will also be handy.
