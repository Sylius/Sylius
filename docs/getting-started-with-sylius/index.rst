Getting Started with Sylius
===========================

This tutorial is dedicated to Sylius newcomers, who want to check out our system quickly - see basic configuration, do some simple customizations,
and be able to sell the first products in their new webshop. It shows the quickest and simplest way from the idea ("I want to sell some stuff online")
to the first results ("I can sell some stuff online!").
