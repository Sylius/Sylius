Inventory
=========

Sylius leverages a very simple approach to inventory management. The current stock of an item is stored on the *ProductVariant* entity.

It is always accessible via simple API:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    echo $productVariant->getOnHand(); // Prints current inventory.

Every variant also has an unique code and can be available on demand, if you do not want to have strict inventory tracking.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    $variant = $product->getFirstVariant();
    $variant->setAvailableOnDemand(false);

    if ($variant->isAvailableOnDemand()) {
        // Order any amount you want!
    }

InventoryUnit
-------------

Every item sold in the store is represented by *InventoryUnit*, which has many different states:

* checkout - When item is in the cart.
* onhold - When checkout is completed, but we are waiting for the payment.
* sold - When item has been sold and is no longer in the warehouse.
* backordered - Item has been sold, but is not in stock and waiting for supply.
* returned - Item has been sold, but returned and is in stock.

For example, if someone puts a product "Book" with quantity "4" in the cart, 4 inventory units are created. This allows us for very precise tracking of all sold/backordered/returned items.

InventoryUnitFactory
--------------------

Normally, inventory units are created automatically by Sylius and you do not need to bother. If you want to create some inventory units yourself, you should use the ``sylius.inventory_unit_factory`` service.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    use Sylius\Inventory\Model\InventoryUnitInterface;

    $variant = // Get variant from product.
    $inventoryUnits = $this->get('sylius.inventory_unit_factory')->create($variant, 6, InventoryUnitInterface::STATE_BACKORDER);

``$inventoryUnits`` is now ArrayCollection with 6 instances of InventoryUnit, referencing the *ProductVariant* and with state `backordered`.

InventoryOperator
-----------------

Inventory operator is the service responsible for managing the stock amounts of every *ProductVariant* with following methods:

* increase(variant, quantity)
* hold(variant, quantity)
* release(variant, quantity)
* decrease(InventoryUnit[])
