Contact
=======

The functionality of contacting the shop support/admin is in Sylius very basic. Each **Channel** of your shop may have
a ``contactEmail`` configured on it. This will be the email address to support.

Contact form
------------

The contact form can be found on the ``/contact`` route.

.. note::

   When the ``contactEmail`` is not configured on the channel, the customer will see the following flash message:

   .. image:: ../../_images/contact_request_error.png
      :align: center

The form itself has only two fields ``email`` (which will be filled automatically for the logged in users) and ``message``.

ContactEmailManager
-------------------

The **ContactEmailManager** service is responsible for the sending of a contact request email.
It can be found under the ``sylius.email_manager.contact`` service id.

ContactController
-----------------

The controller responsible for the request action handling is the **ContactController**.
It has the ``sylius.controller.shop.contact`` service id.

Configuration
-------------

The routing for contact can be found in the ``Sylius/Bundle/ShopBundle/Resources/config/routing/contact.yml`` file.
By overriding that routing you will be able to customize **redirect url, error flash, success flash, form and its template**.

You can also change the template of the email that is being sent by simply overriding it
in your project in the ``app/Resources/SyliusShopBundle/views/Email/contactRequest.html.twig`` file.
