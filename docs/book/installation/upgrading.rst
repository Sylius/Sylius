Upgrading
=========

Sylius regularly releases new versions according to our :doc:`release process </contributing/organization/release-process>`.
Each minor release comes with an ``UPGRADE.md`` file, which is meant to help in the upgrading process.

1. **Update the Sylius library version constraint by modifying the ``composer.json`` file:**

    .. code-block:: yaml

        {
            "require": {
                "sylius/sylius": "^1.4"
            }
        }

2. **Upgrade dependencies by running a Composer command:**

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ composer update sylius/sylius --with-all-dependencies

    If this does not help, it is a matter of debugging the conflicting versions and working out how your ``composer.json`` should look after the upgrade.
    You can check what version of Sylius is installed by running ``composer show sylius/sylius`` command.

3. **Follow the instructions found in the ``UPGRADE.md`` file for a given minor release.**
