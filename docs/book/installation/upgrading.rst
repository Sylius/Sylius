Upgrading
=========

Sylius is releasing new versions from time to time. Each release is supported with an `UPGRADE <https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/UPGRADE.md>`_ file, which is meant to help in the upgrading process,
especially for the major versions, which can break the backwards compatibility.

**Update the Sylius library version constraint by modifying the** ``composer.json`` **file:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    {
        ...

        "require": {
            "...": "...",

            "sylius/sylius": "^1.0@beta",

            "...": "...",
        },

        ...
    }

**Then run** ``composer update`` **command:**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer update sylius/sylius

If this results in a dependency error, it may mean that other Sylius dependencies also have to be upgraded.
Using this command may help you upgrade Sylius dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer update sylius/sylius --with-dependencies

If this does not help, it is a matter of debugging the conflicting versions and working out how your ``composer.json`` should look after the upgrade.

**Finally to make everything work check the UPGRADE file of Sylius for instructions.**

**One more important thing is running the database migrations:**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

.. tip::

    Check if the migrations (more than 1) are in your ``app/migrations`` directory. If not, then replace the contents
    of this directory with the migrations from the ``vendor/sylius/sylius/app/migrations/`` directory.

After fixing the project according to the upgrade and having run the migrations you are done!
