Payments
========

Sylius contains a very flexible payments management system with support for many gateways (payment providers).
We are using a payment abstraction library - `Payum <https://github.com/Payum/Payum>`_, which handles all sorts of capturing, refunding and recurring payments logic.

On Sylius side, we integrate it into our checkout and manage all the payment data.

Payment
-------

Every payment in Sylius, successful or failed, is represented by the **Payment** model, which contains basic information and a reference to appropriate order.

Payment State Machine
---------------------

A Payment that is assigned to an order will have it's own state machine with a few available states:
``cart``, ``new``, ``processing``, ``completed``, ``failed``, ``cancelled``, ``void``, ``refunded``.

The available transitions between these states are:

.. code-block:: yaml

    transitions:
        create:
            from: [cart]
            to: new
        process:
            from: [new]
            to: processing
        complete:
            from: [new, processing]
            to: completed
        fail:
            from: [new, processing]
            to: failed
        cancel:
            from: [new, processing]
            to: cancelled
        refund:
            from: [completed]
            to: refunded
        void:
            from: [new, processing]
            to: void

Of course, you can define your own states and transitions to create a workflow, that perfectly matches your needs.
Full configuration can be seen in the `PaymentBundle/Resources/config/app/state_machine.yml <https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Bundle/PaymentBundle/Resources/config/app/state_machine.yml>`_.

Changes to payment happen through applying appropriate transitions.

How to create a Payment programmatically?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

We cannot create a Payment without an Order, therefore let's assume that you have an Order to which you will assign a new payment.

.. code-block:: php

    $payment = $this->container->get('sylius.factory.payment')->createNew();

    $payment->setOrder($order);
    $payment->setCurrencyCode('USD');

    $this->container->get('sylius.repository.payment')->add($payment);

.. tip::

    Not familiar with the Order concept? Check :doc:`here </book/orders>`.

Payment Methods
---------------

A [PaymentMethod] represents a way that your customer pays during the checkout process. It holds a reference to a specific *gateway* with custom configuration.
You can have different payment methods using the same gateway, like PayPal or Stripe.

How to create a PaymentMethod programmatically?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

As usually, use a factory to create a new PaymentMethod and give it a unique code.
The payment gateways of your system are available under the ``sylius.payment_gateways`` parameter.

.. code-block:: php

    $paymentMethod = $this->container->get('sylius.factory.payment_method')->createNew();
    $paymentMethod->setCode('ALFA1');

    $gateways = $this->container->getParameter('sylius.payment_gateways');

    $paymentMethod->setGateway($gateways['offline']);

    $this->container->get('sylius.repository.payment_method')->add($paymentMethod);

In order to have your new payment method available in the checkout remember to **add it to your desired channels**:

.. code-block:: php

    $channel->addPaymentMethod($paymentMethod);

Payment Gateway and Configurations
----------------------------------

In order to add a new gateway, configure it in the ``app/config.yml`` file of your project in such a way:

.. code-block:: yaml

    payum:
        gateways:
            paypal_express_checkout:
                factory: "paypal_express_checkout"
                payum.http_client: "@sylius.payum.http_client"
                username: "TEST"
                password: "TEST"
                signature: "TEST"
                sandbox: "true"

.. tip::

    If you are not sure why this configuration looks like that head to `Payum`_ documentation.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Sylius stores the payment output inside the **details** column of the **sylius_payment** table.
It can provide valuable information when debugging the payment process.

PayPal Error Code 10409
-----------------------

The 10409 code lso known as the *"Checkout token was issued for a merchant account other than yours"* error.
You have most likely changed the PayPal credentials from *config.yml* during the checkout process. Clear the cache and try again:

.. code-block:: bash

    app/console cache:clear
