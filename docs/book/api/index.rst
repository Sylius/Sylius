API
===

.. warning::

    The new, unified Sylius API is still under development, that's why the whole ``ApiBundle`` is tagged with ``@experimental``.
    This means that all code from ``ApiBundle`` is excluded from :doc:`Backward Compatibility Promise </book/organization/backward-compatibility-promise>`.

To use this API remember to generate JWT token. For more information, please visit `jwt package documentation <https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle/blob/v2.11.0/Resources/doc/index.md#generate-the-ssl-keys>`_.

This part of the documentation is about the currently developed unified API for the Sylius platform.
