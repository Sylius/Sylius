The Release Cycle
=================

This document explains the **release cycle** of the Sylius project (i.e. the
code & documentation hosted on the main ``Sylius/Sylius`` `repository`_).

Sylius follows the `Semantic Versioning`_ strategy:

* A new Sylius patch version (e.g. 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.) comes out usually *once a month*, depending on the number of bug fixes developed
* A new Sylius minor version (e.g. 1.1, 1.2, etc.) is released depending on various factors (see below), usually *once a few months*

New Sylius minor releases will drop unsupported PHP versions.

Scope-based vs time-based
-------------------------

Sylius **release cycle** is **not** strictly time-based (contrary to the `Symfony release cycle`_). Based on the experience
from over 10 minor versions, we decided that time is not the only reason on which we should rely when planning the new Sylius'
version. Therefore, each new minor release of Sylius takes in consideration:

* what we would like to include in it (features, improvements, fixes)

* when we would like to release it (based on the Team capacity, estimated amount of work and experience from previous minor releases development)

.. note::

    The natural consequence of such a decision is uncertainty regarding the exact time of the next minor version release.
    We try to estimate it as precisely as possible, but sometimes delays cannot be avoided. We believe that
    releasing a **good** product is more important than releasing it **fast** ðŸ¤–

Development
-----------

The full development period for any minor version is divided into two phases:

* **Development**: *First 5/6 of the time intended for the release* to add new features and to enhance existing ones.

* **Stabilization**: *Last 1/6 of the time intended for the release* to fix bugs, prepare the release, and wait
  for the whole Sylius ecosystem (third-party libraries, plugins, and projects using Sylius) to catch up.

During both periods, any new feature can be reverted if it won't be
finished in time or won't be stable enough to be included in the coming release.

Maintenance
-----------

Each minor Sylius version is maintained for a fixed period of time after its release.
This maintenance is divided into:

* *Bug fixes and security fixes*: During this period all issues can be fixed.
  The end of this period is referenced as being the *end of maintenance* of a release.

* *Security fixes only*: During this period, only security related issues can be fixed.
  The end of this period is referenced as being the *end of life* of a release.

Backward Compatibility
----------------------

All Sylius releases have to comply with our :doc:`Backward Compatibility Promise <backward-compatibility-promise>`.

Whenever keeping backward compatibility is not possible, the feature, the
enhancement or the bug fix will be scheduled for the next major version.
