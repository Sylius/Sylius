Inventory
=========

Sylius leverages a very simple approach to inventory management. The current stock of an item is stored on the **ProductVariant** entity as the ``onHand`` value.

InventoryUnit
-------------

InventoryUnit has a relation to a `Stockable <https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Component/Inventory/Model/StockableInterface.php>`_ on it,
in case of Sylius Core it will be a relation to the **ProductVariant** that implements the StockableInterface on the **OrderItemUnit** that implements the InventoryUnitInterface.

It represents a physical unit of the product variant that is in the shop.

Inventory On Hold
-----------------

Putting inventory items ``onHold`` is a way of reserving them before the customer pays for the order. Items are put on hold when the checkout is completed.

.. tip::

   Putting items ``onHold`` does not remove them from ``onHand`` yet. If a customer buys 2 tracked items out of 5 being
   in the inventory (``5 onHand``), after the checkout there will be ``5 onHand`` and ``2 onHold``.

Availability Checker
--------------------

There is a service that will help you check the availability of items in the inventory
- `AvailabilityChecker <https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Component/Inventory/Checker/AvailabilityChecker.php>`_.

It has two methods ``isStockAvailable`` (is there at least one item available)  and ``isStockSufficient`` (is there a given amount of items available).

.. tip::

   There are two respective twig functions for checking inventory: ``sylius_inventory_is_available`` and ``sylius_inventory_is_sufficient``.

OrderInventoryOperator
----------------------

Inventory Operator is the service responsible for managing the stock amounts of every *ProductVariant* on an Order with the following methods:

* ``hold`` - is called when the order's checkout is completed, it puts the inventory units onHold, while still not removing them from onHand,
* ``sell`` - is called when the order's payment are assigned with the state ``paid``. The inventory items are then removed from onHold and onHand,
* ``release`` - is a way of making onHold items of an order back to only onHand,
* ``giveBack`` - is a way of returning sold items back to the inventory onHand,
* ``cancel`` - this method works both when the order is paid and unpaid. It uses both ``giveBack`` and ``release`` methods.

How does Inventory work on examples?

.. tip::

   You can see all use cases we have designed in Sylius in our `Behat scenarios for inventory <https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/tree/master/features/inventory>`_.
