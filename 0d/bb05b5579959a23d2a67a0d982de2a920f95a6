This looks dangerous for me cause cleaning whole entity manager means that you remove **everything** that was put in it, either it was already saved or not into database, which means side effects in live applications can be unpredictable IMHO.

I agree with @stloyd. Usually it's flush then clear, doing just a clear is not a good idea.
