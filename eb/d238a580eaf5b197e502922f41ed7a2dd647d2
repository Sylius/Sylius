Hi Joost,

Looks good overall, there's just one thing.
Could you add the `@api @ui` tags to the other scenarios inside `viewing_sorted_products_multiple_channels.feature`?
Right now only the `Sorting products by their prices with ascending order on channel Poland` gets run.
I highly doubt they'd fail, but just to be sure.

Cheers
