It's only a change in the fixtures (and there's no way to get `en_UK` locale or `UK` country using the admin panel).

I'm wondering, how much is it possible to have a store with such configuration. It seems that ~upgrading of this library~ merging of #10565 changes our behavior slightly

These are only fixtures (and it won't change the behaviour of existing applications).
