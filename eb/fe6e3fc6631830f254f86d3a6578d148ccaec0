This should be merged into `1.8` as bugfix.

And we should force this lib to be installed in v4.4, to ensure that it works as expected

It also works with 5 as the signature has parameter wider than the interface.

I'm aware of that, but we do not test it at all. And still, we do not support Symfony 5.0 anyway

Okay, then should I add this?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you can, yes please.
