PHP Components
==============

We provide a set of well-tested and decoupled PHP libraries.

The components are the foundation of the Sylius platform, but they can also
be used standalone with any PHP application even if you use a framework different than Symfony.

These packages solve common E-Commerce and web application problems. Have a look around this documentation to see if you will find them useful!

We recommend checking out :doc:`/components/general/index`, which will get you started in minutes.
