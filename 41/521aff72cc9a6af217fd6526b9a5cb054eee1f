To fail the test it require more than just adding product related to another, it require also to change the php config : `memory_limit` or `max_execution_time` to a lower values.

I will try fail it with products related to another, because in my case I have only 20 products and the bug occurred.

Would be awesome to have failing test for that, to prevent regression in the future

I was not enable to set a timeout on the request but the test will fail if the `serialization_groups` is changed because the json result will be different.

For the record here is the failing test :
