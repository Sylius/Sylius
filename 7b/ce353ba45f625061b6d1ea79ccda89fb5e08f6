Behat test is failing with api context.
IMO it is normal, since the API controller does not use the same method of the repository.
So we have to create a ProductCollectionDataProvider for the api part to use the right query builder.

@GSadee @coldic3 Could you accept this pull request for the shop part, even if we open a new issue/PR for the api part?

Yes, as the API part requires additional and slightly different work to fix the issue, we could do that in a separate PR 👌🏻

It would be nice if you tidy up your commits better, for instance, squash or reset all commits `git reset HEAD~8` and then commit them again with a more descriptive commit message
