PS. 1.3 should be targeted I suppose

No, this works. A session key should be with the prefix.

> Also, can we change the configuration to see if it really works? There should be a feature for user impersonification.

You can just set
```
security:
    always_authenticate_before_granting: true
```

in config/packages/security.yaml file and try to impersonate any customer from the admin panel. Without this patch you get infinity redirect to /login, because security layer wants to re-authenticate token but can't find a provider and redirects the request to login page, but login page not showing to a user with existed token.. and everything goes for the second lap.

sorry for my wrong formed PR, unfortunately I don't work with github and open source often. Should I create the new one with correct target branch?

The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. **Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up.**

Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute `git fetch origin && git reset "patch-1"` to update your local branch.

Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck :+1:

I'm not a good with Behat and BDD, but I'm think yes. Test user should be logged in to admin panel, next, impersonate any customer and go to the shop area. And of course
```
security:
    always_authenticate_before_granting: true
```
must be set to true
