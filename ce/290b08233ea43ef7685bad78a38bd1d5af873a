@lchrusciel Is it in the behat scenario that you'd like to have a product with translation?

@laurent35240 I think that is what @lchrusciel meant. Maybe we should check if adding the distinct clause does not affect joining the translations table in any way.

Yup. I prefer to ensure, that we are not adding any regression. However, there should be some tests for that anyway.
