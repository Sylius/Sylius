@pamil For me, no impact on column length or indices after 5.7.7. According to my searches.

Indeed, looks like a change that we should do then! `utf8` is an alias for `utf8mb3` which is deprecated in favour of `utf8mb4`. I'm just wondering how to upgrade existing projects to `uft8mb4`, considering these concerns here: https://serversforhackers.com/c/mysql-utf8-and-indexing

The issue with the indices is gone after 5.7.7 :).

I don't think soâ€¦ maybe a warning in the UPGRADE?
