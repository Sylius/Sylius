Anyway, that it looks really promising üëç Can we proceed with the migration movement right now, to start preparation?

BTW. Huge kudos to doctrine team üéâ

I guess we first need to figure out if we can move migrations to another directory (+ change their namespace) safely and make sure that we don't reference the moved migrations in some upgrade instructions.

There's a new library on the market: https://github.com/SyliusLabs/DoctrineMigrationsExtraBundle

I split the migrations into CoreBundle and AdminApiBundle, tested the upgrade path manually (run migrations on master branch, switched to this PR branch, run migrations again) and it works fine.

Had to add one extra migration to split AdminApiBundle parts from the initial migration (added a thorough comment there). Removed `skipIf` calls as they cause Migrations v3 to fail, replaced them with empty returns.

I'm not sure whether we should keep the old migrations, but we can think it through while creating an upgrade guide for Sylius applications.

I'd say it's good to merge and afterwards I'll update the remaining repositories to comply with the new migrations architecture.
