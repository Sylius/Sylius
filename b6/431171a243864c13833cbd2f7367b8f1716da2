Hi @pamil and @lchrusciel, I don't know why but this PR won't trigger the Travis CI build. Do you know why? Anyway it's ready for review.

Hi @lchrusciel the build does not trigger continuous-integration/travis-ci/pr. It happened even few weeks ago and you resolved by closing and reopening, can you do the same?

of course ;)

Hi guys @lchrusciel @pamil @Zales0123 , I made the requested changes and commented others. This PR is ready to be reviewed again.
The build is failing on some features but it doesn't seem to be related to my changes. It's strange that it's green for 7.4 and not for 7.3

Hi @lchrusciel @pamil @Zales0123, I resolved a conflict in this PR related to the inheritdoc removal.
I think that this PR is ready to merge.
It would be great if we could have this feature in Sylius 1.8.

Let me know if there's something I can do to help.
