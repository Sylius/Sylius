@pamil Thank you for your patience. I had pretty busy months working on Rector fulltime lately, finally found some time to address your comments.

I find these 2 points - https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/issues/424#issuecomment-447122540 - genious. I'll definitely integrate them to Rector.

Let me know if there is something more you need me to do :+1:

Hello @TomasVotruba, sorry for such a long response time, we realize that sometime we can loose some valuable PRs in the workload we have. I would say it's still a good change and I would vote to merge. Let me only ping @pamil and @lchrusciel for the quick opinion... It only needs a quick rebase, as far as I see. I'm also reopening it, if you don't mind :)

The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up.

Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute git fetch origin && git reset "authorize-payment" to update your local branch.

Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck üëç
