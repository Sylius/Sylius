I am trying to write a behat test but I am not sure how to mock the dependencies properly. The other commands use the container aware command as their base class which is deprecated. Should the `GenerateCouponCommand` also use this and if not how do I instantiate it.

What about some functional test with PHPunit, where we will generate some commands and assert if they are available in the database?

I will try to get to it this evening.

Is there any kind of reference for a command that is tested with phpunit?

https://symfony.com/doc/current/console.html#testing-commands this can be useful, for the start
