@CoderMaggie, @Zales0123: Is it possible to get a code review before writing the Behat tests. I am still a Behat newb, so I would like to know that the functionality is what you expect and everything else is okay before I dive into that :D

@loevgaard some more comment, rebase is also needed, but generally, it's close to be merged, in my opinion ðŸ––

I've added a few mostly minor comments (with update of 1.7 to 1.8 version in deprecation). We are getting close to merging it ;)
