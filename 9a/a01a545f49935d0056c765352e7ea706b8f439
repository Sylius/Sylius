Hi @mtarld I now look at your PR you talked to me during the forum PHP. This seems great, could you add a PHPUnit tests for that? https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/1.11/tests/Api/Shop/OrdersTest.php

@mtarld Could you rebase your PR please?

@loic425, I just rebased the branch, do you still want me to update the tests? (I may have time for it today)
