IMO, filters should be set in the `<th>` of each attribute if possible, and in a separate block if they deal with multiple/no specific attribute.

That's what any other CMS do and it feels very intuitive.

The matching can be done by name (replacing '.' by '_') or with a specific configuration line.

And for the filter block itself. The global width of number inputs is way too large.

In the first screenshot the number value field has an icon, what's that? Should it be for the customer input?
