I wouldn't leave this gem to get lost

I would add to this debug panel for cart the promotions that were evaluated for eligibility and why they were rejected or not. With the current implementation, it takes a lot of concentration to understand why a promotion was applied to cart or why it didn't.

and if you have a couple of hundred of them... things can get really really messy.
