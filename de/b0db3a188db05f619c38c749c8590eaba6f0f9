Hi, guys.
Any chance this PR will be merged?

Hello Igor,

this PR was red due to the problem with the side library. I have restarted a build.

Could you document the behavior that you want to add in this PR? It would be great if our docs informed the users about the `load_default_locale` flag.

Good idea, but I don't know where should it be placed. We don't have any option documented around fixtures configuration.

Thus, we can open an issue about missing documentation after merging this PR

I'm a little bit afraid it can be written and forgotten :( Maybe we can add a quick note in [this chapter](https://docs.sylius.com/en/1.4/book/architecture/fixtures.html#what-data-is-loaded-by-fixtures-in-sylius) of documentation? Just to not forget it and **then** open an issue about missing documentation üòÑ

I'm voting for merging this feature and let's focus on documentation form in separate PR (#10393)
