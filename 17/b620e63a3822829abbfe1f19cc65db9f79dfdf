@stefandoorn can you confirm this is still not working?
AFAIK the code related to bulk actions was changed in the meantime, including the confirmation modal.
Now the modal is bound by a data attribute: `data-bulk-action-requires-confirmation`.

Ahhh -- do you have the commit where it got changed, @vvasiloi? I can check, but I'm not on the last version.

@stefandoorn I checked again and that logic was never changed, so it's probably still a bug: https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/60f806c36ce7ee4c1f5aa444e3cc46490e566c32/src/Sylius/Bundle/UiBundle/Resources/private/js/sylius-bulk-action-require-confirmation.js
