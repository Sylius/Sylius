üëç but the build failed, so probably there is something wrong with the migrations... can you take a look at it @loic425?

@Zales0123 it proves the changes work :smile:
I'll take a look soon.

@Zales0123 I check it out. This is not really a migration problem cause database cannot be reverted until first version due to data unique on sylius product translation unique index (slug, locale).

I think we have to empty database before or move this test before testing fixtures and behat features.

Empty database could hide some problems... But the only other solution is to remove duplicated translations to match the old unique key and this is not acceptable too...
