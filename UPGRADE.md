# UPGRADE FROM 1.0.0-beta.1 to 1.0.0-beta.2

## Packages:

### Addressing / AddressingBundle

### AdminBundle

### ApiBundle

* All api routes are prefixed with version number. For example route: `/api/customers` has changed to `/api/v1/customers`. 

### Attribute / AttributeBundle

* `AttributeValue::$localeCode` property was added to make it translatable. Now, every attribute value has a locale code to be displayed properly in different locales. All attribute values are migrated to the new concept with migration `Version20170109143010`. Look at [this PR](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/pull/7219) if you have any problems with upgrade.

### Channel / ChannelBundle

### Core / CoreBundle

* `ImageUniqueCode` and `ImageUniqueCodeValidator` were deleted and replaced by `UniqueWithinCollectionConstraintValidator`, `UniqueWithinCollectionConstraint` from `ResourceBundle`.
  To use it replace name of constraint in constraint mapping file from: `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Validator\Constraints\ImageUniqueCode`
  to: `Sylius\Bundle\ResourceBundle\Validator\Constraints\UniqueWithinCollectionConstraint`

* Renamed ``getLastNewPayment()`` on ``OrderInterface`` to ``getLastPayment($state)``, where ``$state`` is target last payment state. Every ``getLastNewPayment()`` method should be replaced with ``getLastPayment(PaymentInterface::STATE_NEW)``.

* `Sylius\Component\Core\OrderProcessing\OrderTaxesProcessor` and `Sylius\Component\Core\Resolver\ZoneAndChannelBasedShippingMethodsResolver` 
  have become a zone scope aware. From now, only zones with scope 'shipping' or 'all' will be considered in `Sylius\Component\Core\Resolver\ZoneAndChannelBasedShippingMethodsResolver` 
  and a scope 'tax' or 'all' is required in `Sylius\Component\Core\OrderProcessing\OrderTaxesProcessor`. 
  A migration file has been prepared  which fill in "all" as scope for zones that didn't have it specified, so they will be resolved by new implementation.

* State resolvers have been made final. In order to change theirs behavior please decorate them or provide your own implementation. 

### Currency / CurrencyBundle

                        type: entity
                        options:
                            class: "%app.model.channel%"
                            fields: [channel]

                        options:
                            fields: [channel]
                        form_options:
