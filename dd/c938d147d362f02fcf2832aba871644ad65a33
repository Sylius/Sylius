After a quick research, although there is this postal code you referred, but it is written as `0001` not just `1`

Yes, that is correct, but does users adhere to standards? No :) The same in Denmark. We also have 4 digit postal codes, but there are postal codes like 0983. When people order, they write 983 obviously.
