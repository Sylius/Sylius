Would be wonderful if we could add tooltips explaining what are these.
Moreover, I would improve the UX, by making the code length field shorter and the prefix/suffix fields with some placeholders `I.e. 2019SALE_`

@CoderMaggie agreed 👍 However, as it's a UI/UX job, I would leave it as it is in this PR (to not make it longer than needed) and let somebody more experienced with front-end (probably @kulczy 😄) do the job 🚀
