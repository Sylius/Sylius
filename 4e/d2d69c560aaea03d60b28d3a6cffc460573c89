Isn't that something Symfony already does https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html#redirecting-urls-with-trailing-slashes?

Yes, indeed and this is what I use to fix the problem.
But the slug is wrong with the trailing slash.

https://demo.sylius.com/en_US/taxons/caps/with-pompons/
In this example, $slug equals to "taxons/caps/with-pompons/" instead of "taxons/caps/with-pompons" => 404

With my change, the slug is now fixed and Symfony makes a redirection without the trailing slash.

Hey Loic,
