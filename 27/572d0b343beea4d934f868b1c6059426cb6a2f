@panigrc thank you for the scenarios, but it would be great to also have implementation for them :) üññ ‚òÆÔ∏è

@Zales0123 thank you for pointing that out, I saw that the Behat tests were failing.
I did a small change with the 1f39662a74880f0577f26ebf191128c7425b4c63 but I didn't find any other places in which I need to implement the scenarios.

I could use a little help to understand how to implement the scenarios.

Hey @panigrc, do you still want to finish this? I can help with the tests.

Hi @vvasiloi, sorry for not answering sooner your message, I forgot about this PR.
I haven't used Sylius for a while now and I think it's better to reject this PR.

@panigrc no problem, maybe someone else will finish it.
