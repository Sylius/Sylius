# UPGRADE FROM `v1.12.X` TO `v1.13.0`

1. Class `Sylius\Component\Core\Promotion\Updater\Rule\TotalOfItemsFromTaxonRuleUpdater` has been deprecated, as it is no more used.

1. Class `Sylius\Component\Core\Promotion\Updater\Rule\ContainsProductRuleUpdater` has been deprecated, as it is no more used.

1. Class `Sylius\Bundle\ProductBundle\Form\Type\ProductOptionChoiceType` has been deprecated.
   Use `Sylius\Bundle\ProductBundle\Form\Type\ProductOptionAutocompleteType` instead.

1. Starting with Sylius 1.13, the `SyliusPriceHistoryPlugin` is included.
   If you are currently using the plugin in your project, we recommend following the upgrade guide located [here](UPGRADE-FROM-1.12-WITH-PRICE-HISTORY-PLUGIN-TO-1.13.md).

1. The `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\CatalogPromotion\Command\RemoveInactiveCatalogPromotion` command and its handler
   `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\CatalogPromotion\CommandHandler\RemoveInactiveCatalogPromotionHandler` have been deprecated.
   Use `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\CatalogPromotion\Command\RemoveCatalogPromotion` command instead.

1. Passing `Symfony\Component\Messenger\MessageBusInterface` to `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\CatalogPromotion\Processor\CatalogPromotionRemovalProcessor`
   as a second and third argument is deprecated.

1. Not passing `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\CatalogPromotion\Announcer\CatalogPromotionRemovalAnnouncerInterface` to `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\CatalogPromotion\Processor\CatalogPromotionRemovalProcessor`
   as a second argument is deprecated.

1. Not passing `Doctrine\Persistence\ObjectManager` to `Sylius\Component\Core\Updater\UnpaidOrdersStateUpdater`
   as a fifth argument is deprecated.

1. To ease customization we've introduces attributes for some services in `1.13`:
   - `Sylius\Bundle\OrderBundle\Attribute\AsCartContext` for cart contexts
   - `Sylius\Bundle\OrderBundle\Attribute\AsOrderProcessor` for order processors
   - `Sylius\Bundle\ProductBundle\Attribute\AsProductVariantResolver` for product variant resolvers

   By default, Sylius still configures them using interfaces, but this way you cannot define a priority.
   If you want to define a priority, you need to set the following configuration in your `_sylius.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   sylius_core:
       autoconfigure_with_attributes: true
   ```
   and use one of the new attributes accordingly to the type of your class, e.g.:
   ```php
    <?php

    declare(strict_types=1);

    namespace App\OrderProcessor;

    use Sylius\Bundle\OrderBundle\Attribute\AsOrderProcessor;
    use Sylius\Component\Order\Model\OrderInterface;
    use Sylius\Component\Order\Processor\OrderProcessorInterface;

    #[AsOrderProcessor(/*priority: 10*/)] //priority is optional
    final class OrderProcessorWithAttributeStub implements OrderProcessorInterface
    {
        public function process(OrderInterface $order): void
        {
        }
    }
   ```

1. Not passing `Sylius\Component\Core\Checker\ProductVariantLowestPriceDisplayCheckerInterface` 
   to `Sylius\Component\Core\Calculator\ProductVariantPriceCalculator`
   as a first argument is deprecated.

1. Not passing an instance of `Symfony\Component\PropertyAccess\PropertyAccessorInterface`
   to `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Validator\Constraints\HasEnabledEntityValidator`
   as the second argument is deprecated.

1. Not passing an instance of `Sylius\Component\Core\Payment\Remover\OrderPaymentsRemoverInterface`
   and a collection of unprocessable order states to `Sylius\Component\Core\OrderProcessing\OrderPaymentProcessor`
   as the third and fourth arguments respectively is deprecated.

1. Not passing an instance of `Sylius\Component\Core\Distributor\ProportionalIntegerDistributorInterface`
   to `Sylius\Component\Core\Taxation\Applicator\OrderItemsTaxesApplicator` and to `Sylius\Component\Core\Taxation\Applicator\OrderItemUnitsTaxesApplicator`
   as the last argument is deprecated.

1. Class `\Sylius\Bundle\ShopBundle\Calculator\OrderItemsSubtotalCalculator` has been deprecated. Order items subtotal calculation
   is now available on the Order model `\Sylius\Component\Core\Model\Order::getItemsSubtotal`.

1. The way of getting variants prices based on options has been changed,
   as such the following services were deprecated, please use their new counterpart.
   * instead of `Sylius\Component\Core\Provider\ProductVariantsPricesProviderInterface` use `Sylius\Component\Core\Provider\ProductVariantMap\ProductVariantsMapProviderInterface`
   * instead of `Sylius\Component\Core\Provider\ProductVariantsPricesProvider` use `Sylius\Component\Core\Provider\ProductVariantMap\ProductVariantsPricesMapProvider`
   * instead of `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Templating\Helper\ProductVariantsPricesHelper` use `Sylius\Component\Core\Provider\ProductVariantMap\ProductVariantsPricesMapProvider`
   * instead of `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Twig\ProductVariantsPricesExtension` use `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Twig\ProductVariantsMapExtension`

   Subsequently, the `sylius_product_variant_prices` twig function is deprecated, use `sylius_product_variants_map` instead.

   To add more data per variant create a service implementing the `Sylius\Component\Core\Provider\ProductVariantMap\ProductVariantMapProviderInterface` and tag it with `sylius.product_variant_data_map_provider`.

1. Using Guzzle 6 has been deprecated in favor of Symfony HTTP Client. If you want to still use Guzzle 6 or Guzzle 7,
   you need to install `composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter` or `composer require php-http/guzzle7-adapter`
   depending on your Guzzle version.
   Subsequently, you need to register the adapter as a `Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface` service as the following:
    ```yaml
        services:
            Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface:
                class: Http\Adapter\Guzzle7\Client # for Guzzle 6 use Http\Adapter\Guzzle6\Client instead
    ```

1. The constructor of `Sylius\Bundle\AdminBundle\Controller\NotificationController` has been changed:

    ```diff
        public function __construct(
    -       private ClientInterface $client,
    -       private MessageFactory $messageFactory,
    +       private ClientInterface|DeprecatedClientInterface $client,
    +       private RequestFactoryInterface|MessageFactory $requestFactory,
            private string $hubUri,
            private string $environment,
    +       private ?StreamFactoryInterface $streamFactory = null,
        ) {
            ...
        }
    ```

1. The `sylius.http_message_factory` service has been deprecated. Use `Psr\Http\Message\RequestFactoryInterface` instead.

1. The `sylius.http_client` has become an alias to `psr18.http_client` service.

1. The `sylius.payum.http_client` has become a service ID of newly created `Sylius\Bundle\PayumBundle\HttpClient\HttpClient`.

1. Validation translation key `sylius.review.rating.range` has been replaced by `sylius.review.rating.not_in_range` in all places used by Sylius. The `sylius.review.rating.range` has been left for backward compatibility and will be removed in Sylius 2.0.

1. The `payum/payum` package has been replaced by concrete packages like `payum/core`, `payum/offline` or `payum/paypal-express-checkout-nvp`. If you need any other component so far provided by `payum/payum` package, you need to install it explicitly.

1. PostgreSQL migration support has been introduced. If you are using PostgreSQL, we assume that you have already created a database schema in some way.
   All you need to do is run migrations, which will mark all migrations created before Sylius 1.13 as executed.

1. Product variants resolving has been refactored for better extendability.
   The tag `sylius.product_variant_resolver.default` has been removed as it was never used.

   All internal usages of service `sylius.product_variant_resolver.default` have been switched to `Sylius\Component\Product\Resolver\ProductVariantResolverInterface`, if you have been using the
   `sylius.product_variant_resolver.default` service apply this change accordingly.

1. Due to optimizations of the Order's grid the `Sylius\Component\Core\Repository\OrderRepositoryInterface::createSearchListQueryBuilder` method bas been deprecated and replaced by `Sylius\Component\Core\Repository\OrderRepositoryInterface::createCriteriaAwareSearchListQueryBuilder`.
   Also `Sylius\Component\Core\Repository\OrderRepositoryInterface::createByCustomerIdQueryBuilder` has been deprecated and replaced by `Sylius\Component\Core\Repository\OrderRepositoryInterface::createByCustomerIdCriteriaAwareQueryBuilder` for the same reason. Both changes affect
   `sylius_admin_order` and `sylius_admin_customer_order` grids configuration.

1. We have explicitly added relationships between product and reviews and between product and attributes in XML mappings.
   Because of that, the subscribers `Sylius\Bundle\AttributeBundle\Doctrine\ORM\Subscriber\LoadMetadataSubscriber` 
   and `Sylius\Bundle\ReviewBundle\Doctrine\ORM\Subscriber\LoadMetadataSubscriber` have changed so that it does not add 
   a relationship if one already exists. If you have overwritten or decorated it, there may be a need to update it. 

1. Passing an instance of `Sylius\Component\Resource\Translation\Provider\TranslationLocaleProviderInterface` as the first argument
    to `Sylius\Bundle\AttributeBundle\Form\Type\AttributeType\Configuration\SelectAttributeChoicesCollectionType` has been deprecated.

1. The `sylius_admin_ajax_taxon_move` route has been deprecated. If you're relaying on it, consider migrating to new
    `sylius_admin_ajax_taxon_move_up` and `sylius_admin_ajax_taxon_move_down` routes.

1. Not passing a `$fileLocator` to `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Fixture\Factory\ProductExampleFactory` constructor is deprecated and will be prohibited in Sylius 2.0.

1. Interface `Sylius\Bundle\ShopBundle\Calculator\OrderItemsSubtotalCalculatorInterface` and class `Sylius\Bundle\ShopBundle\Twig\OrderItemsSubtotalExtension` responsible for the `sylius_order_items_subtotal` twig function have been deprecated and will be removed in Sylius 2.0.
   Use the `::getItemsSubtotal()` method from the `Order` class instead.

1. The `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Fixture\Factory\PaymentFixture` has been deprecated. Use `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Fixture\PaymentFixture` instead.

1. Not passing a `$router` to `Sylius\Bundle\AdminBundle\Controller\ImpersonateUserController` as the fourth argument is deprecated and will be prohibited in Sylius 2.0.

1. The `Sylius\Bundle\CoreBundle\Provider\SessionProvider` has been deprecated and will be removed in Sylius 2.0.

1. Interface `Sylius\Component\Core\Promotion\Updater\Rule\ProductAwareRuleUpdaterInterface` has been deprecated and will be removed in Sylius 2.0.
