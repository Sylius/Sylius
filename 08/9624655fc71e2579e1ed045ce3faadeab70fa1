Hello @lchrusciel,

I have tested on my Sylius project before send this PR. I dont know how you want test a Symfony FormType : Behat, PHPSpec, PHP Unit ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lchrusciel at 2020-03-03T14:40:40Z

We already have a few form type tests, like this one: https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Bundle/AddressingBundle/Tests/Form/Type/ZoneChoiceTypeTest.php

Could you try to reproduce and perhaps cover this issue, so we will not have a regression in the future?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@lchrusciel I have added the test.

I have rebase on branch 1.6

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lchrusciel at 2020-03-05T14:11:10Z

It's something wrong with the branch. We need to wait for #11179 to merge this PR

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lchrusciel at 2020-03-06T08:48:42Z

Can you rebase again? Build should be green now

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by macintoshplus at 2020-03-20T08:37:33Z

@lchrusciel Sorry, after many rebase, the tests does not pass

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi @lchrusciel,

I have rebase to Sylius 1.7. But tests fail. Why ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by macintoshplus at 2020-05-31T21:59:00Z

Related #11149

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey Jean-Baptiste ðŸ‘‹

could you rebase your PR to the newest master? The build should be green then.

I need rebase to merge in 1.7 branch or master ? Actually the origin branch is 1.7 to merge into 1.7 branch.

ping @lchrusciel

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lchrusciel at 2020-06-16T10:02:58Z

My mistake, of course, it should be rebased to 1.7.

The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. **Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up.**

Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute `git fetch origin && git reset "fix/issue_11149"` to update your local branch.

Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck :+1:

@lchrusciel I have rebase my branch... The test error is not caused by this PR changes. How to relaunch to attempt to pass the test ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lchrusciel at 2020-07-16T07:41:26Z

Tests at the bottom are rerun and passes. The problem is with static analysis: https://travis-ci.org/github/Sylius/Sylius/jobs/707744459#L2451

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by macintoshplus at 2020-07-17T20:16:13Z

I have fix the Psalm error (locally checked). I'm horrified by the need to add specific comment in code to pass static analysis.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by macintoshplus at 2020-07-21T14:53:23Z

Enjoy! All check is done and no conflict! My PR can be merged @lchrusciel!
