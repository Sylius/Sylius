Contributing Patches and BDD Methodology
========================================

Sylius is a Open Source project driven by the community. Join our amazing adventure and we promise to be nice and welcoming to everyone. Remember, you do not have to be a Symfony guru or even a programmer to help!

You can learn [how to contribute the patches](http://docs.sylius.com/en/latest/contributing/code/patches.html)
and [how we use Behat & PHPSpec](http://docs.sylius.com/en/latest/contributing/code/bdd.html)
in two separate parts of our [Contributing Guide](http://docs.sylius.com/en/latest/contributing/index.html).
