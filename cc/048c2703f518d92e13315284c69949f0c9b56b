Hi there! Great to see new Sylius contributors ðŸ’ª

Regarding the PR, I assume this is a long existent bug, therefore you should open this PR to the lowest possible branch -> 1.2 :)

And please, next time, edit the PR template, as you have left it untouched.

Thanks!

I saw you have some troubles rebasing the PR (like I did for a first hundred of them), so I made it for you :) We've got a basic section explaining it in our docs (https://docs.sylius.com/en/1.2/contributing/code/patches.html#rework-your-patch), but I think we need to make it a bit more straightforward and more accessible.

Hello @cosyz2010, do you think you will be able to adjust tests, as @lchrusciel was asking for? It would be great to have it merged :)

The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. **Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up.**

Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute `git fetch origin && git reset "patch-1"` to update your local branch.

Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck :+1:
