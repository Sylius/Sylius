@Zales0123
All comments resolved. I've added an option to define redirect route from yml. I've decided to put "the default" value in a code anyway just to be sure we'll never spot `null` there. Also I've removed spec for `Render` action but after implementing the `define redirect route` option I've decided to left the second action. If you still feel we should remove it just let me know 🖖🏼.

@AdamKasp
Most of your comments are resolved, just 2 need your interaction :D.

@GSadee, after a conversation with @NoResponseMate I've dropped his three commits and I've resolved all your comments. While adding information about changes in `security.yaml` I noticed we didn't mention a similar change in the case of API. I've included it in the same PR as all API-related PR are already merged ✌🏻.
