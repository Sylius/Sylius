What about performances? Isn't it heavier to have all services public?

According to Mateusz posts(https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/pull/13641#discussion_r804760104) we already have 964 services, all of them(or at least majority) are public. So creation of new private services probably have neglectable influence over the website.

The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. **Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up.**

Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute `git fetch origin && git reset "adr-public-services"` to update your local branch.

Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck :+1:
