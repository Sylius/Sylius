The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. **Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up.**

Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute `git fetch origin && git reset "patch-6"` to update your local branch.

Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck :+1:

OR ðŸ˜„ in fact I'm not 100% sure should we merge it without adding the same feature on `OrderItem`, `OrderItemUnit` and `Shipment` level - currently no adjustment is added to `Order` directly, so we *cannot* be sure it does not break anything, as these change would not be covered by any Behat scenario ðŸ’ƒ
