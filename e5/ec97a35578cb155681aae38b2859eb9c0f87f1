However, can you rebase to the newest master and check how will it behave together with #11571?

Also, will it remember which cards have been collapsed and which not? It could be annoying for users to always toggle them.

Hi @lchrusciel
Thanks :)
For #11571 , it's already present in my pull request :smiley:  :

The first screenshot was not up to date sorry :P

I created my pull request from the master so the task is there :)
For your question, I am using the "current_ancestor" class already present and I have not touched the html structure. With this class, if an item is active, the entire block remains open.
In the JavaScript function, I have provided a parameter that allows opening a menu to close the others if a user prefers this system. All JavaScript script is documented in JSDoc standards !
