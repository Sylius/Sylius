Probably good to add a link to the new repository/packagist in UPGRADE e.g.?

@stefandoorn there's no end-user action required, so I guess `CHANGELOG-1.3.md` with `TL;DR` (also included in release notes) should be enough, what do you think?

Ah, true. Was thinking about plugins etc., but they rely on Sylius also and therefore no issue.
