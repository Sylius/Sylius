Can this be merged?

Hey @tavy315,

thanks a lot for your contribution and your patience. It can be merged to the master, however we have a red build there. Once it is fixed I will ping you back

Ok, no problem. Not sure if I can help there.
By the way, targeted branch was 1.7 since all the changes were also merged into that branch, see https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/commit/186c13c25009904d00e322a2fb2259065099340b

My mistake should be merged to 1.7

Hey Octav, could you rebase your work to branch 1.7?

@lchrusciel, sorry, I think I merged it instead. I'm still not used to sync and rebase a fork.
