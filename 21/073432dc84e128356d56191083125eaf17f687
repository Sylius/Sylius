Now that I see this I think the checklist should've also contained 'add global parameters that apply to all grids'.

Oh, wait... there were global params, but you removed them... never mind.

@vvasiloi yes I removed them because we decided to have by default `true` for both and add this doc :)

The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. **Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up.**

Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute `git fetch origin && git reset "add-snippet-with-fetch-collection-and-output-walkers-disabling"` to update your local branch.

Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck :+1:
