I see 1 failing scenario but the error seems to be unrelated whit this change

What I mean is that because 1.1.1 is still installed, we can't verify whether 2.0 is working correctly.

It is blocked by `hwi/oauth-bundle` currently, which is required in dev cause it's an optional integration.

 `hwi/oauth-bundle` has just released version `1.0` which now depends on `"php-http/guzzle6-adapter":     "^2.0"`
