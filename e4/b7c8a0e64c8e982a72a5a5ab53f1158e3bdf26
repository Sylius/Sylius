@Zales0123 is it useful or shall I stop? 😄
For some reason I chose to add single comments instead of starting a review, so you've probably received a ton of notifications... sorry.

Thank you @vvasiloi for the review! I would never believe someone would be determined enough to take a look at it. I'm impressed 👏 I've fixed (hopefully) most of the comments, I've just left those about collection type hints, as I'm not 100% sure how the IDE would handle these types without them 🤷 . Still, can be improved later 🖖

Thank you! 🎉
