Thanks. Is it okay to be a MR to the master branch or should I also target older versions as well?

I see no reason to not have it in 1.10 and 1.11 too.

I have rebased it now.

Appearently someone was quicker than me. #13750

But I still think that we should replace the placeholder image in Sylius with a more good looking icon.

I have re-added the image. But the build is still failing for some reason.

I have fixed it. I accidentally removed the `i` tag that renders the icon while rebasing.

The failure exists in the frontend as far as I know which I didn't touch. Does someone have an idea how to fix that. I can't really get any helpful information from the Github Action Logs.

I've rerun all failed jobs, perhaps it will help

Yep it's green.
