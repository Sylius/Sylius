@Zales0123 Is there something possible to do after tagging?

Yep, that part's absolutely needed (and the action's docs cover that).

> I'm not sure do `user_name` and `user_email` should be mine (or anywhere else)... maybe we should use Sylius and [hello@sylius.com](mailto:hello@sylius.com)?

If the Symplify tool works similarly to `splitsh-lite`, the author here should really only matter for tags and mostly just affects the releases page on the read-only repo (just look at the tags in https://github.com/symfony/console/tags or https://github.com/Pagerfanta/twig/tags, both are read-only split repos).

@loic425 @mbabker aggreed, I just wanted to start simple and then extend the action (maybe I'm too cautious ðŸ˜„ but I still have 5% of uncertainty would it work well :dancer:)

@Zales0123 Yes, let's start simple, you're right, I prefer tiny PRs

Yea I would go with ex github@sylius.com or any other email/user. We could even make it a little more fun and make Swan Bot <3 ðŸ¦¢

I guess I could generate a token for @SyliusBot account ðŸ¤” It seems as the best option for now ðŸ––
