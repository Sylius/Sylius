# UPGRADE FROM `2.2` TO `2.3`

## Dependencies

1. The `behat/transliterator` package has been **deprecated** and will be removed in Sylius 3.0.

    Slug generation now **primarily** uses `symfony/string` (`Symfony\Component\String\Slugger\SluggerInterface`).
    When no `$slugger` is injected, the system falls back to `Behat\Transliterator\Transliterator`, but this fallback behavior is deprecated and will be removed in Sylius 3.0.

   The following classes have been updated — if you have extended or decorated them, update your constructor accordingly:

   - `Sylius\Component\Product\Generator\SlugGenerator`:

     ```diff
     -public function __construct()
     +public function __construct(private ?SluggerInterface $slugger)
     ```

     > **Deprecated:** Passing `null` as `$slugger` (or omitting it) is deprecated since Sylius 2.3.
     > When `null` is passed, the generator falls back to `Behat\Transliterator\Transliterator`.
     > Both the nullable argument and the `behat/transliterator` fallback will be removed in Sylius 3.0.

   - `Sylius\Component\Taxonomy\Generator\TaxonSlugGenerator`:

     ```diff
     -public function __construct()
     +public function __construct(private ?SluggerInterface $slugger)
     ```

     > **Deprecated:** Same as above.

   - `Sylius\Bundle\AdminBundle\Generator\TaxonSlugGenerator`:

     ```diff
      public function __construct(
          private BaseTaxonSlugGeneratorInterface $slugGenerator,
     +    private ?SluggerInterface $slugger,
      )
     ```

     > **Deprecated:** Same as above.

   The `StringInflector::nameToSlug()` method has been **deprecated** and will be removed in Sylius 3.0.

2. The `knplabs/gaufrette` and `knplabs/knp-gaufrette-bundle` packages have been removed.

   The Gaufrette integration has been unusable as a filesystem adapter.
   Since Sylius 2.0 the default filesystem adapter uses Flysystem instead. 

   If your application depends on the Gaufrette packages directly, require them explicitly in your `composer.json`.
