Hi Magdalena,

Thank you very much for your feedback. I really appreciate it. :D
It is quite lengthy indeed, I totally agree with your suggestions and will process them.

I feel at some point in time we should somehow edit the original model customization guide and introduce a step 1 that allows the reader to determine what kind of model they are trying to customize and immediately point them to the right section (so having separate instructions for each case, like we have a section for regular models and a section for translated models now).
However we currently don't have a good way to do that, so we can always revisit it when we have that figured out.
