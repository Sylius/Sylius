I tried to check it out before the merge and I realized some strange bug - I believe it's related to the `LanguageBundle`, not proposed changes. The thing is, a translator does not accept compound locales codes (like `pl_PL`, `de_DE`, `jp_JP`), it works only with few of them (as `en_US`) ðŸ˜•

@oallain can you check it out? We should not allow such behaviour, especially as I think these two-parts codes are *the right ones* ðŸš€ Thank you in advance!

Hi @Zales0123,

I missed that, `Intl::getLanguageBundle()->getLanguageName($language, $region)` has 2 arguments, it was the cause of the malfunction.

I have now fixed the problem. :smile:
