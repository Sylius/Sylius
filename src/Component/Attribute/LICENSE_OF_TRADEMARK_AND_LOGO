Encourage widespread and fair use of Sylius logo and brand identity.

This Trademarks and Logos use policy (the “Policy”) is based on the Ubuntu 
and Symfony trademark policy and published under the CC-BY-SA license. You 
are welcome to base your own project trademark policies off it, just let 
others use your changes and give credit to the Ubuntu and Symfony projects 
as the original source!

Version n°1. Published on April 5th 2019.

The objective of the Policy is to encourage widespread use of the Sylius 
trademarks by the Sylius community while controlling that use in order to 
avoid confusion on the part of Sylius users and the general public, to 
maintain the value of the image and reputation of the trademarks and to 
protect them from inappropriate or unauthorised use.

The sections below describe what is allowed, what isn’t allowed, and cases 
in which you should ask permission.
If you have any doubt, please contact us and a member of our legal 
representative will be in touch with you shortly.
If you are aware a breach or misuse of the Sylius trademarks in any 
way, we would appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Please 
contact us so that we can investigate this further.

The Trademarks and Logos
Sylius sp. z o.o. owns the verbal trademark containing 
in whole or part of the word “Sylius”.

Any verbal mark starting with the letters “Sylius” is sufficiently 
similar to one or more of the trademarks that permission will be 
needed in order to use it.

All verbal trademarks of Sylius sp. z o.o., all distinctive signs used in 
commerce by Sylius sp. z o.o. to designate his products or services related 
to Sylius are collectively referred to as the “Trademarks”.

Permitted use of the Trademarks
Certain usages of the Trademarks are fine and no specific permission 
from us is needed.

Community advocacy. Sylius is built by its community. We share access to 
the Trademarks with the entire community for the purposes of discussion, 
development and advocacy. We recognise that most of the open source discussion 
and development areas are for non-commercial purposes and will allow the 
use of the Trademarks in this context, provided:

the Trademark is used in a manner consistent with this Policy;
there is no commercial intent behind the use;
what you are referring to is in fact Sylius. If someone is confused into 
thinking that what isn’t Sylius is, in fact, Sylius, you are probably doing 
something wrong;
there is no suggestion (through words or appearance) that your project is 
approved, sponsored, or affiliated with Sylius, Sylius sp. z o.o. or its 
related projects unless it actually has been approved by and is accountable 
to Sylius sp. z o.o. and the Sylius Project.
Building on Sylius or for Sylius. If you are producing new software which is 
intended for use with or on Sylius, you may use the Trademark in a way which 
indicates the intent of your product. For example, if you are developing a 
system management tool for Sylius, acceptable project titles would be 
“System Management for Sylius” or “Sylius Based Systems Management”. We would 
strongly discourage, and likely would consider to be problematic, a name such 
as SyliusMan, Sylius Management, etc. Furthermore, you may not use the 
Trademarks in a way which implies an endorsement where that doesn’t exist, 
or which attempts to unfairly or confusingly capitalise on the goodwill 
or brand of the project.

Commentary and parody. The Trademarks and Logos are designed to cover use of 
a mark to imply origin or endorsement by the project. When a user downloads 
something called Sylius, they should know it comes from the Sylius project. 
This helps Sylius build a reputation that will not be damaged by confusion 
around what is, and isn’t, Sylius. Using the Trademarks in your discussion, 
commentary, criticism or parody, in ways that unequivocally do not imply 
endorsement, is permissible. Anyone is free to write articles, create 
websites, blog about, or talk about Sylius — as long as it’s clear to 
everyone — including people completely unfamiliar with Sylius — that they 
are simply referring to Sylius and in no way speaking for the Sylius 
project and/or for Sylius sp. z o.o.

We reserve the right to review all usage within the open source community, 
and to object to any usage that appears to overstep the bounds of discussion 
and good-faith non-commercial development. In any event, once a project has 
left the open source project phase or otherwise become a commercial project, 
this Policy does not authorise any use of the Trademarks in connection to 
that project.

Restricted use that requires a trademark licence
Permission from us is necessary to use any of the Trademarks under any 
circumstances other than those specifically permitted above.

These include but are not limited to:

Any commercial use including for any services related to Sylius such as 
providing training services, conference services, or design services (should 
you wish to provide such services, please contact us beforehand to explore 
Sylius Solution Partner Program);
Use on or in relation to a software product that includes or is built on top 
of a product supplied by us, if there is any commercial intent associated 
with that product;
Use in a domain name or URL;
Use for merchandising purposes, e.g. on t-shirts and the like.
If you wish to have permission for any of the uses above or for any other use 
which is not specifically referred to in this Policy, please contact us and 
we’ll let you know as soon as possible if your proposed use is permissible. 
Permission may only be granted subject to certain conditions and these may 
include the requirement that you enter into an agreement with us to maintain 
the quality of the product and/or service which you intend to supply at a 
prescribed level.

While there may be exceptions, it is very unlikely that we will approve 
Trademark use in the following cases:

Use of a Trademark in a company name;
Use of a Trademark in a domain name which has a commercial intent. The 
commercial intent can range from promotion of a company or product, to 
collecting revenue generated by advertising;
The calling of any software or product by the name Sylius (or another 
related Trademark);
Use in combination with any other marks or logos. This include use of 
a Trademark in a manner that creates a “combined mark,” or use that 
integrates other wording with the Trademark in a way that the public may 
think of the use as a new mark (for example Club Sylius or SyliusBooks, or 
in a way that by use of special fonts or presentation with nearby words or 
images conveys an impression that the two are tied in some way);
Use in combination with any product or service which is presented as being 
Certified or Official or formally associated with us or our products or 
services;
Use in a way which implies an endorsement where that doesn’t exist, or which 
attempts to unfairly or confusingly capitalise on the goodwill or brand of 
the project;
Use of a Trademark in a manner that disparages Sylius, or Sylius sp. z o.o.; 
or its products and is not clearly third-party parody;
Use of a Trademark on or in relation to a software product which constitutes 
a substantially modified version of a product supplied by the Sylius project, 
that is to say with material changes to the code, or services relating to 
such a product; and
Use of a Trademark in a title or metatag of a web page whose sole intention or 
result is to influence search engine rankings or result listings (for example 
use as keyword for advertising purposes), rather than for discussion, 
development or advocacy of the Trademarks.
Logo usage guidelines
Except otherwise agreed, any use of Logos shall be expressly authorized by 
writing by Sylius sp. z o.o.. To get any authorization to use any Logo, 
please contact us and a member of our team will be in touch with you shortly.

Our logos are presented in multiple colours and it is important that their 
visual integrity be maintained.

Therefore, when use of Logos is authorized, it is therefore preferable that 
the logos only be used in their standard form but if you should feel the need 
to alter them in any way you should keep the following guidelines in mind.

It should also be borne in mind that the more you wish to vary our logos 
from their standard form the smaller is the chance that we will be able to 
approve your proposed use.

If presented in multiple colours, the logo should only use the “official” 
logo colours.
You may use transparency and gradient/depth tools but should retain the 
“official” colours.
Any scaling must retain the original proportions of the logo.
In case of non-compliance with Trademarks and Logos’ Use Policy or 
applicable law, any use of the Trademarks and/or Logos will be prohibited.
