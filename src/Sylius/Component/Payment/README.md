Payment Component [![Build status...](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Sylius/Payment.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Sylius/Payment)
=================

Sylius Payment component **does not** provide any gateways. It is only a raw
architecture for managing payments and payment methods. It can be integrated
with many different services, but Sylius uses [Payum](http://payum.forma-dev.com/) by default.
