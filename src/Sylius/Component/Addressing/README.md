Addressing Component [![Build status...](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Sylius/Addressing.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Sylius/Addressing)
====================

Addresses management is a common task for almost every eCommerce project.  
This component provides basic models and services for handling addresses in
your PHP application.

Countries can contain multiple provinces (states).

This component supports very flexible zones system, which allows you to group countries and provinces into geographical areas.
Every address can be matched against all defined zones, which is useful for tax or shipping systems.
