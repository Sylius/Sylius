About project "Sylius".
-----------------------

Sylius is meant to be a e-commerce system build on Symfony2 and by its community.
The goal is to create a end-user application that will be developer friendly.
Most of parts are fully functional and are powering 2 online shops that run in production.
The work is focused on the bundles like PluginsBundle and ThemingBundle.
More bundles are one their way to github. Stay tuned.

**Please note!** I know that many of this bundles are far from being perfect.
I just want to share my work with others and also learn something new.
