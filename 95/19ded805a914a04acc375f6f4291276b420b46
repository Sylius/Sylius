Hello @delyriand 👋🏼,
can you add a note about the changed model's interface to the `1.12`'s upgrade file, please?

Hi @jakubtobiasz!

I've just added a step to the update file for version 1.12.

Sylius uses https://github.com/SyliusLabs/PolyfillSymfonySecurity which handles interface mismatch for [UserInterface](https://github.com/SyliusLabs/PolyfillSymfonySecurity/blob/main/src/Core/User/UserInterface.php) as well, should this fix be added over there, while SF5 is supported?

@loic425 Hi, what do you think?

That's a good question, the existing Pollyfill is to create a bc-layer to keep compatibility with legacy Symfony versions.
It's for complex bc-layer, here it's simple cause it works with Symfony 5 and 6.
