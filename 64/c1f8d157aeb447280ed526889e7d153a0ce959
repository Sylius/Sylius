According to the product’s picture it’s definitely a « bonnet », even if there is only one word for both « casquette » and « bonnet » in English.

Oh, I didn't understand why you were talking about pictures, but the picture didn't actually show on my browser 😅 I opened it with another browser and I saw it.

Totally okay then 👍

> As you're a native, I suppose you're right

Seconded, this is a _bonnet_ in French.

The base of this pull-request was changed, you need fetch and reset your local branch
if you want to add new commits to this pull request. **Reset before you pull, else commits
may become messed-up.**

Unless you added new commits (to this branch) locally that you did not push yet,
execute `git fetch origin && git reset "patch-1"` to update your local branch.

Feel free to ask for assistance when you get stuck :+1:
