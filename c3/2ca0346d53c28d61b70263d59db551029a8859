Hello @loic425! It's definitely a change we would like to make, but it has to be rebased with the `master` branch. As far as I know, you will have some fun with solving the conflicts in `LocaleSetup` and `CountryNameExtension` :) I hope you'll find some time to do it üöÄ Tests also need some polishing üññ

The master branch requires Symfony ^4.3 now, could be merged after being rebased and having conflicts fixed.

@pamil Done, let's wait for Travis build.
