Hi guys,
Why not use nested set behavior for taxons position ? It’s already implemented on database...  otherwise I don't see what use it would be.
#7585 this issue is about it too.

Hi @ehibes 👋🏼,
thanks for sharing your thoughts. This PR aims to fix the existing behavior, the issue you share might be considered in a longer term (e.g. Sylius `2.0` or `3.0` as it might require analysis + refactoring and changes in the behavior).

Is this works?

```
$taxonToBeMoved->setPosition($taxonToBeMoved->getPosition() - 1);
```

It just doing the same `-1` as we had before (when things did not work), but on backend side rather than on front-end side - that is all the difference. Did someone tested this by hands?

There's an if statement preventing moving the taxon to `-1` positions. Behat tests are passing that way, and we tested it yesterday.
