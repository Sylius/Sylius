Facing the issue that after the step `When I choose main taxon "Sad"`, each time the element is not visible (e.g. `And I specify its code as "WHISKEY_GENTLEMEN"`). How can I reset that? Also facing this issue while developing a plugin.

@stefandoorn I've committed some tricky changes to your PR, I hope you don't mind, they should fix the build :)

Thanks! ðŸŽ‰ Should we can also move that AutocompleteHelper to the `UpdateConfigurableProductPage::selectMainTaxon`?

Rebased to 1.2 (adding a missing test looks like a bugfix for me) and updated with scalar typehints (as they were introduced by @Zales0123 in the other PR in the meantime). I guess the last comment can be solved by another PR :)

Ok :) LGTM.
