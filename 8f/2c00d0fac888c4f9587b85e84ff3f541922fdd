> But why are we disabling opcache for CLI?

It is a good question 😃, to be honest, I'm not sure if is needed, but after this PR, configs for 1.10 and 1.11 branches will be the same, this is what I wanted to achieve.
I will open another PR to revert the change of opcache for CLI to see the status of build 🕵🏻
