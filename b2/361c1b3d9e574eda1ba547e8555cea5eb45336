Hi @diimpp!
Why do you think this service should be marked as public?

Hello @jakubtobiasz,

I cannot tell you exact reason why custom payum actions should be registered as public, but that's the way with SyliusPayumBundle custom actions https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/23dc8d6915b2540f88ffceb7b9ea9a3214543837/src/Sylius/Bundle/PayumBundle/Resources/config/services/action.xml#L8
 as well in my personal experience I was forced to do the same for my custom actions.

There are two service definitions in this doc, xml and yaml. Xml contains correct `public` definition, while yaml misses it. (See related ticket)

@jakubtobiasz hi, what can be done to merge it early? Do you need second review for core team?

@diimpp yep, more votes needed, I pinged the team.
