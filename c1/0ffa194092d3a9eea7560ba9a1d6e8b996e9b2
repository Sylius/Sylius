Hi @toofff! I believe such a customization option is already introduced a level higher [in this file](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Bundle/AdminBundle/Resources/views/Crud/Index/_header.html.twig#L4). It, of course, is a little bit different - but the proposed solution seems as duplicated behaviour.

@Zales0123 I'm not thinking duplicating an existing solution.

Currently we can directly change the `header` and the `subheader` with a translation key that we want to put.
I just wanted to make the code homogeneous for the breadcrumb.

```
app_admin_page:
    resource: |
        alias: app.page
        section: admin
        path: /pages
        templates: "@SyliusAdmin\\Crud"
        redirect: update
        grid: app_admin_page
        permission: true
        vars:
            all:
                breadcrumb: app.ui.page.breadcrumb
                header: app.ui.page.header
                subheader: app.ui.page.subheader
    type: sylius.resource
    prefix: admin
```

However for the `subheader` variable [we can define it with the `subheader` key](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Bundle/AdminBundle/Resources/views/Crud/Index/_headerTitle.html.twig#L3) or [change the template with `header_title` key](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/src/Sylius/Bundle/AdminBundle/Resources/views/Crud/Index/_header.html.twig#L3).

@Zales0123 do I have to keep the branch up to date or do I just delete my pull request?
