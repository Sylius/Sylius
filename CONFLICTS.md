   `ParseError - vendor/symfony/polyfill-mbstring/bootstrap80.php:125:86 - Syntax error, unexpected '=' on line 125 (see https://psalm.dev/173) function mb_scrub(string $string, string $encoding = null): string { $encoding ??= mb_internal_encoding(); return mb_convert_encoding($string, $encoding, $encoding); }`

 - `symfony/property-info:4.4.22|5.2.7`:

   These versions of Symfony PropertyInfo Component introduce a bug with resolving wrong namespace for some translation entities

   Probably introduced in: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/40811
