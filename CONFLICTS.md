# CONFLICTS

This document explains why certain conflicts were added to `composer.json` and
references related issues.

- `lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle: ^2.18`

  After bumping to this version ApiBundle starts failing due to requesting a non-existing `api_platform.openapi.factory.legacy` service.
  As we are not using this service across the ApiBundle we added this conflict to unlock the builds, until we investigate the problem.

- `doctrine/orm:>= 2.16.0`

  This version makes Sylius Fixtures loading fail on the product review fixtures.

- `stof/doctrine-extensions-bundle:1.8.0`

  This version introduced configuring the metadata cache for the extensions, what breaks the `Timestampable` behaviour.
  This package is not exactly the root of the problem, but it started using a bugged feature of the `gedmo/doctrine-extensions` package.
