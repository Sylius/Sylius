This document explains why certain conflicts were added to `composer.json` and
references related issues.

 - `symfony/cache": "^6.0`, "symfony/amqp-messenger": "^6.0", "symfony/doctrine-messenger": "^6.0", 
"symfony/error-handler": "^6.0", "symfony/redis-messenger": "^6.0", "symfony/stopwatch": "^6.0", "symfony/twig-bridge": "^6.0", 
"symfony/var-dumper": "^6.0", "symfony/var-exporter": "^6.0",:

   These libraries still happen to be installed with Sylius if no flex is used. As we don't support Sf6 yet they are conflicted. Installation of symfony/cache v6.0 results with following error:

   ```
   
 - `symfony/password-hasher": "^6.0`:

   This version contains service with a wrong constructor arguments:
   `Invalid definition for service ".container.private.profiler": argument 4 of "JMS\SerializerBundle\Debug\DataCollector::__construct()" accepts "JMS\SerializerBundle\Debug\TraceableDriver", "JMS\SerializerBundle\Debug\TraceableMetadataFactory" passed.`

   References: https://github.com/schmittjoh/JMSSerializerBundle/issues/902

 - `symfony/doctrine-bridge:4.4.16`:

   This version of Doctrine Bridge introduces a bug that causes an issue related to `ChannelPricing` mapping.

 - `symfony/property-info:4.4.22|5.2.7`:

   These versions of Symfony PropertyInfo Component introduce a bug with resolving wrong namespace for some translation entities 
   in Swagger UI docs for API.

   Probably introduced in: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/40811

 - `symfony/dependency-injection:4.4.38|5.4.5`:

   Psalm error: 
   `UndefinedDocblockClass: Docblock-defined class, interface or enum named UnitEnum does not exist`.

 - `symfony/framework-bundle:^4.4.38|^5.4.5`:

   These versions are causing a problem with returning null as token from `Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authentication\Token\Storage\TokenStorage`
   which leads to wrong solving path prefix by `Sylius\Bundle\ApiBundle\Provider\PathPrefixProvider` in API scenarios

 - `api-platform/core:2.7.0`:

   The FQCN of `ApiPlatform\Core\Metadata\Resource\ResourceNameCollection` has changed to:
   `ApiPlatform\Metadata\Resource\ResourceNameCollection` and due to this fact

   references this class throws an exception
  `Class "ApiPlatform\Core\Metadata\Resource\ResourceNameCollection" not found`
