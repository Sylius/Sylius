Any idea why the pipeline's red?

Hi @mamazu 👋

You'll probably need to rebase and push again.
That might fix the build as the content shouldn't make it red, but changing the base branch of a PR tends to bug out the runners, so in the worst-case scenario, you'd need to recreate the PR with the 2.0 base branch directly.
Try rebasing first though, maybe it'll kick in.

Cheers 🍻

Thanks @NoResponseMate I rebased it and it's green now.

@Rafikooo Is there anything that's preventing it from being merged into 2.0?

@mamazu shouldn't there be a mysql migration as well?

@Rafikooo why this change needs to be merged at 2.0 and not upcoming 1.14 (or even 1.13)? Change seems like a performance fix and backward compatible.

@diimpp that's a good question I haven't worked with sylius' migration system. I thought the migration is being run on both mysql and postgres. If not then I need to look into that.
