Hello Joachim! Thank you for your fix... but I'm wondering why it was not detected before ðŸ˜„ To be honest, I see no places where this placeholder is visible in the Admin panel - did you encounter this problem somewhere or just saw a missing translation? :) If it's not needed, maybe we should just remove a `placeholder` attribute from the `LocaleChoiceType` ðŸ’ƒ

I used the locale choice type in my own project and then I saw the missing translation key. From my point of view it would be no problem to delete although I really like placeholders :D You decide, @Zales0123 ;)
